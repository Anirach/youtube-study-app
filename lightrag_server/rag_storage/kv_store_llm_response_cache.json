So, here's how I when building with AI. So, here's how I when building with AI. So, here's how I actually work. About half the time, I'm actually work. About half the time, I'm actually work. About half the time, I'm hands-on with my codebase. And that hands-on with my codebase. And that hands-on with my codebase.

But that waiting has added even again. But that waiting has added even again. But that waiting has added even more friction than I realized because more friction than I realized because more friction than I realized because even with how far today's models have even with how far today's models have even with how far today's models have come and their competence with handling come and their competence with handling come and their competence with handling complex multifile changes, it's that complex multifile changes, it's that complex multifile changes, it's that waiting. It's that friction. It's real. waiting. It's that friction. It's real. waiting. It's that friction. It's real.

And so in my view, the killer new feature in Cursor 2.0 is much killer new feature in Cursor 2.0 is much killer new feature in Cursor 2.0 is much larger than just a feature. Cursor larger than just a feature. Cursor larger than just a feature. Cursor launched Composer 1. That's the first launched Composer 1. That's the first launched Composer 1. That's the first large language model from the team at large language model from the team at large language model from the team at Cursor. And calling this thing fast is Cursor.

The majority of recent updates in technology have been incremental improvements with minimal real impact on actual development workflows.\n2. Cursor 2.0 has introduced significant changes that have fundamentally altered the daily workflow of product builders.\n3. Two notable features of Cursor 2.0 that have made a meaningful shift in development workflows are the introduction of dual modes: agent mode and editor mode.\n4. These new modes cater to the distinct ways builders work, allowing for both delegation of large features to automated agents and hands-on, detailed work with real-time monitoring and final adjustments.\n5. Cursor has historically been a code editor enhanced with \"agent superpowers,\" but Cursor 2.0 has innovated on how these capabilities are utilized, making the delegation of work to autonomous tools like codecs, cloud code, or background agents more seamless and effective.\n6. The video aims to explore how Cursor 2.0's updates are changing the way professionals build and interact with AI in their development processes.\n7. Brian Castle hosts the video, focusing on aiding professionals to stay ahead of the curve with AI developments, and he shares insights through his weekly builder briefing at buildermethods.com.\n\n--- Full Transcript ---\nMost recent updates we've seen have been Most recent updates we've seen have been incremental at best. There have been incremental at best. There have been incremental at best. There have been some new models, some new feature drops, some new models, some new feature drops, some new models, some new feature drops, lots of hype, but let's be honest, most lots of hype, but let's be honest, most lots of hype, but let's be honest, most of what we've seen recently from Cloud of what we've seen recently from Cloud of what we've seen recently from Cloud Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've been incremental improvements. Not much been incremental improvements. Not much been incremental improvements. Not much real impact on how we actually build. real impact on how we actually build. real impact on how we actually build. That is until Cursor dropped version two That is until Cursor dropped version two That is until Cursor dropped version two last week, and I can tell you it has last week, and I can tell you it has last week, and I can tell you it has already changed how I actually work. Two already changed how I actually work. Two already changed how I actually work. Two features in particular have features in particular have features in particular have fundamentally changed my day-to-day fundamentally changed my day-to-day fundamentally changed my day-to-day workflow as a product builder. And I'm workflow as a product builder. And I'm workflow as a product builder. And I'm not even talking about the new built-in not even talking about the new built-in not even talking about the new built-in browser or the new voice mode and browser or the new voice mode and browser or the new voice mode and cursor. And those are nice to have. But cursor. And those are nice to have. But cursor. And those are nice to have. But two features that I'll focus on today two features that I'll focus on today two features that I'll focus on today have had an observable meaningful shift have had an observable meaningful shift have had an observable meaningful shift in my entire development workflow. So in my entire development workflow. So in my entire development workflow. So the big headline that you may have heard the big headline that you may have heard the big headline that you may have heard about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, but it does perfectly capture the two but it does perfectly capture the two but it does perfectly capture the two distinct ways that we actually work as distinct ways that we actually work as distinct ways that we actually work as builders. At least it does for me. You builders. At least it does for me. You builders. At least it does for me. You know, sometimes I need to delegate large know, sometimes I need to delegate large know, sometimes I need to delegate large features and let agents cook on those features and let agents cook on those features and let agents cook on those while I go work on something else or while I go work on something else or while I go work on something else or take a break. And other times I want to take a break. And other times I want to take a break. And other times I want to be hands-on, directing agents to make be hands-on, directing agents to make be hands-on, directing agents to make specific changes while I sit here and specific changes while I sit here and specific changes while I sit here and watch them work, and then I'll apply my watch them work, and then I'll apply my watch them work, and then I'll apply my final polish. The new agent mode and final polish. The new agent mode and final polish. The new agent mode and editor mode nail this paradigm. But editor mode nail this paradigm. But editor mode nail this paradigm. But look, cursor has always been a code look, cursor has always been a code look, cursor has always been a code editor with agent superpowers. And we've editor with agent superpowers.\n```",

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

The majority of recent updates in technology have been incremental improvements with minimal real impact on actual development workflows.\n2. Cursor 2.0 has introduced significant changes that have fundamentally altered the daily workflow of product builders.\n3. Two notable features of Cursor 2.0 that have made a meaningful shift in development workflows are the introduction of dual modes: agent mode and editor mode.\n4. These new modes cater to the distinct ways builders work, allowing for both delegation of large features to automated agents and hands-on, detailed work with real-time monitoring and final adjustments.\n5. Cursor has historically been a code editor enhanced with \"agent superpowers,\" but Cursor 2.0 has innovated on how these capabilities are utilized, making the delegation of work to autonomous tools like codecs, cloud code, or background agents more seamless and effective.\n6. The video aims to explore how Cursor 2.0's updates are changing the way professionals build and interact with AI in their development processes.\n7. Brian Castle hosts the video, focusing on aiding professionals to stay ahead of the curve with AI developments, and he shares insights through his weekly builder briefing at buildermethods.com.\n\n--- Full Transcript ---\nMost recent updates we've seen have been Most recent updates we've seen have been incremental at best. There have been incremental at best. There have been incremental at best. There have been some new models, some new feature drops, some new models, some new feature drops, some new models, some new feature drops, lots of hype, but let's be honest, most lots of hype, but let's be honest, most lots of hype, but let's be honest, most of what we've seen recently from Cloud of what we've seen recently from Cloud of what we've seen recently from Cloud Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've been incremental improvements. Not much been incremental improvements. Not much been incremental improvements. Not much real impact on how we actually build. real impact on how we actually build. real impact on how we actually build. That is until Cursor dropped version two That is until Cursor dropped version two That is until Cursor dropped version two last week, and I can tell you it has last week, and I can tell you it has last week, and I can tell you it has already changed how I actually work. Two already changed how I actually work. Two already changed how I actually work. Two features in particular have features in particular have features in particular have fundamentally changed my day-to-day fundamentally changed my day-to-day fundamentally changed my day-to-day workflow as a product builder. And I'm workflow as a product builder. And I'm workflow as a product builder. And I'm not even talking about the new built-in not even talking about the new built-in not even talking about the new built-in browser or the new voice mode and browser or the new voice mode and browser or the new voice mode and cursor. And those are nice to have. But cursor. And those are nice to have. But cursor. And those are nice to have. But two features that I'll focus on today two features that I'll focus on today two features that I'll focus on today have had an observable meaningful shift have had an observable meaningful shift have had an observable meaningful shift in my entire development workflow. So in my entire development workflow. So in my entire development workflow. So the big headline that you may have heard the big headline that you may have heard the big headline that you may have heard about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, but it does perfectly capture the two but it does perfectly capture the two but it does perfectly capture the two distinct ways that we actually work as distinct ways that we actually work as distinct ways that we actually work as builders. At least it does for me. You builders. At least it does for me. You builders. At least it does for me. You know, sometimes I need to delegate large know, sometimes I need to delegate large know, sometimes I need to delegate large features and let agents cook on those features and let agents cook on those features and let agents cook on those while I go work on something else or while I go work on something else or while I go work on something else or take a break. And other times I want to take a break. And other times I want to take a break. And other times I want to be hands-on, directing agents to make be hands-on, directing agents to make be hands-on, directing agents to make specific changes while I sit here and specific changes while I sit here and specific changes while I sit here and watch them work, and then I'll apply my watch them work, and then I'll apply my watch them work, and then I'll apply my final polish. The new agent mode and final polish. The new agent mode and final polish. The new agent mode and editor mode nail this paradigm. But editor mode nail this paradigm. But editor mode nail this paradigm. But look, cursor has always been a code look, cursor has always been a code look, cursor has always been a code editor with agent superpowers.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.
