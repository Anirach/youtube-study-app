The majority of recent updates in technology have been incremental improvements with minimal real impact on actual development workflows.\n2. Cursor 2.0 has introduced significant changes that have fundamentally altered the daily workflow of product builders.\n3. Two notable features of Cursor 2.0 that have made a meaningful shift in development workflows are the introduction of dual modes: agent mode and editor mode.\n4. These new modes cater to the distinct ways builders work, allowing for both delegation of large features to automated agents and hands-on, detailed work with real-time monitoring and final adjustments.\n5. Cursor has historically been a code editor enhanced with \"agent superpowers,\" but Cursor 2.0 has innovated on how these capabilities are utilized, making the delegation of work to autonomous tools like codecs, cloud code, or background agents more seamless and effective.\n6. The video aims to explore how Cursor 2.0's updates are changing the way professionals build and interact with AI in their development processes.\n7. Brian Castle hosts the video, focusing on aiding professionals to stay ahead of the curve with AI developments, and he shares insights through his weekly builder briefing at buildermethods.com.\n\n--- Full Transcript ---\nMost recent updates we've seen have been Most recent updates we've seen have been incremental at best. There have been incremental at best. There have been incremental at best. There have been some new models, some new feature drops, some new models, some new feature drops, some new models, some new feature drops, lots of hype, but let's be honest, most lots of hype, but let's be honest, most lots of hype, but let's be honest, most of what we've seen recently from Cloud of what we've seen recently from Cloud of what we've seen recently from Cloud Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've Code, from codecs, from Gemini, they've been incremental improvements. Not much been incremental improvements. Not much been incremental improvements. Not much real impact on how we actually build. real impact on how we actually build. real impact on how we actually build. That is until Cursor dropped version two That is until Cursor dropped version two That is until Cursor dropped version two last week, and I can tell you it has last week, and I can tell you it has last week, and I can tell you it has already changed how I actually work. Two already changed how I actually work. Two already changed how I actually work. Two features in particular have features in particular have features in particular have fundamentally changed my day-to-day fundamentally changed my day-to-day fundamentally changed my day-to-day workflow as a product builder. And I'm workflow as a product builder. And I'm workflow as a product builder. And I'm not even talking about the new built-in not even talking about the new built-in not even talking about the new built-in browser or the new voice mode and browser or the new voice mode and browser or the new voice mode and cursor. And those are nice to have. But cursor. And those are nice to have. But cursor. And those are nice to have. But two features that I'll focus on today two features that I'll focus on today two features that I'll focus on today have had an observable meaningful shift have had an observable meaningful shift have had an observable meaningful shift in my entire development workflow. So in my entire development workflow. So in my entire development workflow. So the big headline that you may have heard the big headline that you may have heard the big headline that you may have heard about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, about cursor 2.0 are the new dual modes, agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI agent mode and editor mode. Now this UI change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, change alone wouldn't be revolutionary, but it does perfectly capture the two but it does perfectly capture the two but it does perfectly capture the two distinct ways that we actually work as distinct ways that we actually work as distinct ways that we actually work as builders. At least it does for me. You builders. At least it does for me. You builders. At least it does for me. You know, sometimes I need to delegate large know, sometimes I need to delegate large know, sometimes I need to delegate large features and let agents cook on those features and let agents cook on those features and let agents cook on those while I go work on something else or while I go work on something else or while I go work on something else or take a break. And other times I want to take a break. And other times I want to take a break. And other times I want to be hands-on, directing agents to make be hands-on, directing agents to make be hands-on, directing agents to make specific changes while I sit here and specific changes while I sit here and specific changes while I sit here and watch them work, and then I'll apply my watch them work, and then I'll apply my watch them work, and then I'll apply my final polish. The new agent mode and final polish. The new agent mode and final polish. The new agent mode and editor mode nail this paradigm. But editor mode nail this paradigm. But editor mode nail this paradigm. But look, cursor has always been a code look, cursor has always been a code look, cursor has always been a code editor with agent superpowers. And we've editor with agent superpowers. And we've editor with agent superpowers. And we've already had ways to delegate autonomous already had ways to delegate autonomous already had ways to delegate autonomous work to tools like codecs or cloud code work to tools like codecs or cloud code work to tools like codecs or cloud code or even background agents in cursor. So or even background agents in cursor. So or even background agents in cursor. So what's actually different about what what's actually different about what what's actually different about what cursor 2.0 introduced and how is it cursor 2.0 introduced and how is it cursor 2.0 introduced and how is it changing how we work? That's what we'll changing how we work? That's what we'll changing how we work? That's what we'll get into in today's video. And if you're get into in today's video. And if you're get into in today's video. And if you're new here, I'm Brian Castle. I help new here, I'm Brian Castle. I help new here, I'm Brian Castle. I help professionals like you and me stay ahead professionals like you and me stay ahead professionals like you and me stay ahead of the curve when it comes to building of the curve when it comes to building of the curve when it comes to building with AI. And every Friday, I send out my with AI. And every Friday, I send out my with AI. And every Friday, I send out my builder briefing. That's my five-minute builder briefing. That's my five-minute builder briefing. That's my five-minute read to help you stay sharp. You can get read to help you stay sharp. You can get read to help you stay sharp. You can get yours by going to buildermethods.com. yours by going to buildermethods.com. yours by going to buildermethods.com. And subscribers are always the first to And subscribers are always the first to And subscribers are always the first to know about my next live workshop where know about my next live workshop where know about my next live workshop where we talk about what's working right now we talk about what's working right now we talk about what's working right now when building with AI. So, here's how I when building with AI. So, here's how I when building with AI. So, here's how I actually work. About half the time, I'm actually work. About half the time, I'm actually work. About half the time, I'm hands-on with my codebase. And that hands-on with my codebase. And that hands-on with my codebase. And that looks like a continuous cycle where I looks like a continuous cycle where I looks like a continuous cycle where I give a prompt and then watch the agent give a prompt and then watch the agent give a prompt and then watch the agent work and then I wait and then I prompt work and then I wait and then I prompt work and then I wait and then I prompt again. But that waiting has added even again. But that waiting has added even again. But that waiting has added even more friction than I realized because more friction than I realized because more friction than I realized because even with how far today's models have even with how far today's models have even with how far today's models have come and their competence with handling come and their competence with handling come and their competence with handling complex multifile changes, it's that complex multifile changes, it's that complex multifile changes, it's that waiting. It's that friction. It's real. waiting. It's that friction. It's real. waiting. It's that friction. It's real. Because when I'm in the flow working Because when I'm in the flow working Because when I'm in the flow working directly in my codebase, speed is directly in my codebase, speed is directly in my codebase, speed is everything. And so in my view, the everything. And so in my view, the everything. And so in my view, the killer new feature in Cursor 2.0 is much killer new feature in Cursor 2.0 is much killer new feature in Cursor 2.0 is much larger than just a feature. Cursor larger than just a feature. Cursor larger than just a feature. Cursor launched Composer 1. That's the first launched Composer 1. That's the first launched Composer 1. That's the first large language model from the team at large language model from the team at large language model from the team at Cursor. And calling this thing fast is Cursor. And calling this thing fast is Cursor. And calling this thing fast is an understatement. It feels 20, 30, 50 an understatement. It feels 20, 30, 50 an understatement. It feels 20, 30, 50 times faster than any other model on the times faster than any other model on the times faster than any other model on the market right now. You really have to market right now. You really have to market right now. You really have to experience the speed to understand the experience the speed to understand the experience the speed to understand the impact. Now, later in this video, I'll impact. Now, later in this video, I'll impact. Now, later in this video, I'll show you a bigger build, but for now, show you a bigger build, but for now, show you a bigger build, but for now, here's a taste. All right, so for now, here's a taste. All right, so for now, here's a taste. All right, so for now, let's see what the new composer model in let's see what the new composer model in let's see what the new composer model in cursor can do. I'll give it a pretty cursor can do. I'll give it a pretty cursor can do. I'll give it a pretty small change. So, I've been working on small change. So, I've been working on small change. So, I've been working on my buildermethods.com site, and uh one my buildermethods.com site, and uh one my buildermethods.com site, and uh one thing that it's been missing is like a thing that it's been missing is like a thing that it's been missing is like a true about page, you know. So, I've got true about page, you know. So, I've got true about page, you know. So, I've got a lot of information about our free a lot of information about our free a lot of information about our free resources and uh the Builder Methods Pro resources and uh the Builder Methods Pro resources and uh the Builder Methods Pro membership and everything. I've got this membership and everything. I've got this membership and everything. I've got this little letter here, but I wanted like a little letter here, but I wanted like a little letter here, but I wanted like a dedicated about page that kind of speaks dedicated about page that kind of speaks dedicated about page that kind of speaks to what this brand is all about and my to what this brand is all about and my to what this brand is all about and my story behind it and everything. So, I story behind it and everything. So, I story behind it and everything. So, I worked on writing that up over the worked on writing that up over the worked on writing that up over the weekend. And here is the artifact that I weekend. And here is the artifact that I weekend. And here is the artifact that I worked with Claude on creating. And I'm worked with Claude on creating. And I'm worked with Claude on creating. And I'm pretty happy with this. I'll probably pretty happy with this. I'll probably pretty happy with this. I'll probably edit it a little bit further, but you edit it a little bit further, but you edit it a little bit further, but you know, this is a pretty good start for know, this is a pretty good start for know, this is a pretty good start for what I want to put into like an about what I want to put into like an about what I want to put into like an about page. So I'm going to just copy that and page. So I'm going to just copy that and page. So I'm going to just copy that and let's go into I'm starting in agent mode let's go into I'm starting in agent mode let's go into I'm starting in agent mode here. Notice over here I'm selecting here. Notice over here I'm selecting here. Notice over here I'm selecting composer one that is cursors agentic composer one that is cursors agentic composer one that is cursors agentic coding model. Yeah. So let's uh let's coding model. Yeah. So let's uh let's coding model. Yeah. So let's uh let's give this a try. So and I also want to give this a try. So and I also want to give this a try. So and I also want to link to it from the footer. It should link to it from the footer. It should link to it from the footer. It should probably go in one of these. I'll just probably go in one of these. I'll just probably go in one of these. I'll just add it under free resources for now. add it under free resources for now. add it under free resources for now. Okay. So my prompt is pretty simple. Okay. So my prompt is pretty simple. Okay. So my prompt is pretty simple. Like I want to add an about page. This Like I want to add an about page. This Like I want to add an about page. This is the route. This is the controller I is the route. This is the controller I is the route. This is the controller I want to use. I'm asking it to use the want to use. I'm asking it to use the want to use. I'm asking it to use the same uh layout conventions that I've same uh layout conventions that I've same uh layout conventions that I've used on other pages. I want to add a used on other pages. I want to add a used on other pages. I want to add a link to it in the footer. And then here link to it in the footer. And then here link to it in the footer. And then here is the content for this page. And so I is the content for this page. And so I is the content for this page. And so I just pasted in the the markdown from uh just pasted in the the markdown from uh just pasted in the the markdown from uh from the cloud artifact. All right. So from the cloud artifact. All right. So from the cloud artifact. All right. So let's go ahead and uh kick this off. let's go ahead and uh kick this off. let's go ahead and uh kick this off. So it's reading and it's going. Look at So it's reading and it's going. Look at So it's reading and it's going. Look at look at this thing. Wow. Done. Wow. I look at this thing. Wow. Done. Wow. I look at this thing. Wow. Done. Wow. I mean let's let's take a look. You know mean let's let's take a look. You know mean let's let's take a look. You know what? I'm going to use the new built-in what? I'm going to use the new built-in what? I'm going to use the new built-in browser. So I'm going to do uh command browser. So I'm going to do uh command browser. So I'm going to do uh command shiftB. Oops. This is one thing that's shiftB. Oops. This is one thing that's shiftB. Oops. This is one thing that's not so great about cursor so far. I'm not so great about cursor so far. I'm not so great about cursor so far. I'm sure they're going to smooth this out. sure they're going to smooth this out. sure they're going to smooth this out. Is like every time I use keyboard Is like every time I use keyboard Is like every time I use keyboard shortcuts to change the panels, my shortcuts to change the panels, my shortcuts to change the panels, my panels layout gets all out of whack. So, panels layout gets all out of whack. So, panels layout gets all out of whack. So, I hope that that improves. So, anyway, I hope that that improves. So, anyway, I hope that that improves. So, anyway, here we are. If I scroll down. Okay, so here we are. If I scroll down. Okay, so here we are. If I scroll down. Okay, so here is my link to about. And yeah, it here is my link to about. And yeah, it here is my link to about. And yeah, it looks uh looks pretty good. I I didn't looks uh looks pretty good. I I didn't looks uh looks pretty good. I I didn't want to have my face there. And these want to have my face there. And these want to have my face there. And these probably shouldn't be centered. All probably shouldn't be centered. All probably shouldn't be centered. All right. So, not bad. I now one of the right. So, not bad. I now one of the right. So, not bad. I now one of the really cool features of the new browser really cool features of the new browser really cool features of the new browser feature is this select element. So I can feature is this select element. So I can feature is this select element. So I can select an entire div and I can just select an entire div and I can just select an entire div and I can just refer to it. So I want to make all refer to it. So I want to make all refer to it. So I want to make all sections on the page the same width as sections on the page the same width as sections on the page the same width as this div and it's just going to point to this div and it's just going to point to this div and it's just going to point to that and it's sort of covered up there. that and it's sort of covered up there. that and it's sort of covered up there. But you can see it sort of references But you can see it sort of references But you can see it sort of references that that particular div. All right. So that that particular div. All right. So that that particular div. All right. So I'm asking it to make a couple tweaks on I'm asking it to make a couple tweaks on I'm asking it to make a couple tweaks on that. So you know I gave it a bunch of that. So you know I gave it a bunch of that. So you know I gave it a bunch of tweaks that hit like multiple spots and tweaks that hit like multiple spots and tweaks that hit like multiple spots and uh it's already done with them. the uh it's already done with them. the uh it's already done with them. the content a little thinner. Uh, I'm going content a little thinner. Uh, I'm going content a little thinner. Uh, I'm going to change the colors on this. I might to change the colors on this. I might to change the colors on this. I might move this up into the hero, but I'll move this up into the hero, but I'll move this up into the hero, but I'll handle that that like layout stuff a handle that that like layout stuff a handle that that like layout stuff a little bit later. So, let's get on with little bit later. So, let's get on with little bit later. So, let's get on with the video. Now, that was a simple the video. Now, that was a simple the video. Now, that was a simple example, of course, but yesterday, example, of course, but yesterday, example, of course, but yesterday, Composer refactored hundreds of lines in Composer refactored hundreds of lines in Composer refactored hundreds of lines in my codebase, made perfect UI changes, my codebase, made perfect UI changes, my codebase, made perfect UI changes, and it was done in under 20 seconds. And and it was done in under 20 seconds. And and it was done in under 20 seconds. And later yesterday, I needed to add a later yesterday, I needed to add a later yesterday, I needed to add a search feature across multiple models in search feature across multiple models in search feature across multiple models in my app. Again, Composer knocked it out my app. Again, Composer knocked it out my app. Again, Composer knocked it out in 20 seconds. One shot. Now, before in 20 seconds. One shot. Now, before in 20 seconds. One shot. Now, before today, those are examples of tasks that today, those are examples of tasks that today, those are examples of tasks that I would have spent time specking out and I would have spent time specking out and I would have spent time specking out and delegating to an autonomous agent while delegating to an autonomous agent while delegating to an autonomous agent while I go grab coffee or take a walk. But I go grab coffee or take a walk. But I go grab coffee or take a walk. But now, given this new speed, I'm able to now, given this new speed, I'm able to now, given this new speed, I'm able to pull those tasks into my more active pull those tasks into my more active pull those tasks into my more active workflow when I'm sitting here crafting workflow when I'm sitting here crafting workflow when I'm sitting here crafting my product. Now, what's really my product. Now, what's really my product. Now, what's really interesting to me is that Cursor, a interesting to me is that Cursor, a interesting to me is that Cursor, a tools company, is getting into the model tools company, is getting into the model tools company, is getting into the model game. And I think that this could be the game. And I think that this could be the game. And I think that this could be the start of a trend where toolm makers start of a trend where toolm makers start of a trend where toolm makers develop purpose-built models that are develop purpose-built models that are develop purpose-built models that are far superior at their job to be done. far superior at their job to be done. far superior at their job to be done. And in the case of Curser releasing And in the case of Curser releasing And in the case of Curser releasing their first LLM, Composer 1, it makes their first LLM, Composer 1, it makes their first LLM, Composer 1, it makes perfect sense. They have unique training perfect sense. They have unique training perfect sense. They have unique training data from their massive user base of data from their massive user base of data from their massive user base of developers. And they can build a model developers. And they can build a model developers. And they can build a model that's optimized for only one thing, that's optimized for only one thing, that's optimized for only one thing, writing code really fast. And so Cursor writing code really fast. And so Cursor writing code really fast. And so Cursor doesn't have to handle all the other use doesn't have to handle all the other use doesn't have to handle all the other use cases that the models from OpenAI, cases that the models from OpenAI, cases that the models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google need to serve. And I Anthropic, Google need to serve. And I Anthropic, Google need to serve. And I have to think that that's a big reason have to think that that's a big reason have to think that that's a big reason why Cursor's Composer model is just why Cursor's Composer model is just why Cursor's Composer model is just about as competent as Claude Sonnet 4.5, about as competent as Claude Sonnet 4.5, about as competent as Claude Sonnet 4.5, but way faster. Now, like I said, only but way faster. Now, like I said, only but way faster. Now, like I said, only about half my time is spent actually about half my time is spent actually about half my time is spent actually looking at my codebase while my agents looking at my codebase while my agents looking at my codebase while my agents are working on it. The rest of the time, are working on it. The rest of the time, are working on it. The rest of the time, I want to give my agents a big new I want to give my agents a big new I want to give my agents a big new feature to build and have them go off feature to build and have them go off feature to build and have them go off and work autonomously while I work on and work autonomously while I work on and work autonomously while I work on other things or call it a day and come other things or call it a day and come other things or call it a day and come back in the morning. In Cursor 2.0, back in the morning. In Cursor 2.0, back in the morning. In Cursor 2.0, agent mode isn't just a UI update. I agent mode isn't just a UI update. I agent mode isn't just a UI update. I mean, it is, but it introduces something mean, it is, but it introduces something mean, it is, but it introduces something that I think is an even bigger deal. that I think is an even bigger deal. that I think is an even bigger deal. Now, we've had autonomous agents for Now, we've had autonomous agents for Now, we've had autonomous agents for some time now. Cloud code led the way some time now. Cloud code led the way some time now. Cloud code led the way when it pulled us away from our actual when it pulled us away from our actual when it pulled us away from our actual code, and we started trusting our coding code, and we started trusting our coding code, and we started trusting our coding agent to do more work on its own. Then agent to do more work on its own. Then agent to do more work on its own. Then cursor launched background agents. Open cursor launched background agents. Open cursor launched background agents. Open AAI launched codecs. And so we've been AAI launched codecs. And so we've been AAI launched codecs. And so we've been trending into this era of letting agents trending into this era of letting agents trending into this era of letting agents do the work while we interface with the do the work while we interface with the do the work while we interface with the agents. But that only sticks if agents agents. But that only sticks if agents agents. But that only sticks if agents can actually deliver on what we ask of can actually deliver on what we ask of can actually deliver on what we ask of them. And that success rate is what them. And that success rate is what them. And that success rate is what drives our own adoption and our team's drives our own adoption and our team's drives our own adoption and our team's adoption of this more hands-off style of adoption of this more hands-off style of adoption of this more hands-off style of working. The truth is, no matter how working. The truth is, no matter how working. The truth is, no matter how great our specs are or how well we great our specs are or how well we great our specs are or how well we prompt, the more complex the task is, prompt, the more complex the task is, prompt, the more complex the task is, the more variation we see in the success the more variation we see in the success the more variation we see in the success rate from our agents because we know rate from our agents because we know rate from our agents because we know that we can give the same exact prompt that we can give the same exact prompt that we can give the same exact prompt to the same exact model multiple times to the same exact model multiple times to the same exact model multiple times and you can get very different results. and you can get very different results. and you can get very different results. And so, Cursor 2.0 introduced parallel And so, Cursor 2.0 introduced parallel And so, Cursor 2.0 introduced parallel agents and it solves this problem agents and it solves this problem agents and it solves this problem beautifully. It's the easiest way to beautifully. It's the easiest way to beautifully. It's the easiest way to give the same prompt to multiple agents give the same prompt to multiple agents give the same prompt to multiple agents and have them work in parallel and then and have them work in parallel and then and have them work in parallel and then compare their work and decide which one compare their work and decide which one compare their work and decide which one is best. All right, so let's run a demo is best. All right, so let's run a demo is best. All right, so let's run a demo where I'll show you how we can run where I'll show you how we can run where I'll show you how we can run multiple agents in parallel to build out multiple agents in parallel to build out multiple agents in parallel to build out the same thing. So for this demo, I am the same thing. So for this demo, I am the same thing. So for this demo, I am in cursor 2.0. I'm in agent mode and in cursor 2.0. I'm in agent mode and in cursor 2.0. I'm in agent mode and we're going to be building out a simple we're going to be building out a simple we're going to be building out a simple weather app. I have prepared a a prompt. weather app. I have prepared a a prompt. weather app. I have prepared a a prompt. I'm going to pop that in here. Now, now I'm going to pop that in here. Now, now I'm going to pop that in here. Now, now since this is a new app and a bunch of since this is a new app and a bunch of since this is a new app and a bunch of new features and it's, you know, not new features and it's, you know, not new features and it's, you know, not super small. Now, when we're building super small. Now, when we're building super small. Now, when we're building something that's like a medium to large something that's like a medium to large something that's like a medium to large size build, I do like to start uh with a size build, I do like to start uh with a size build, I do like to start uh with a plan. You know, uh spec driven plan. You know, uh spec driven plan. You know, uh spec driven development. The whole value of that is development. The whole value of that is development. The whole value of that is to make sure that the agents and our to make sure that the agents and our to make sure that the agents and our plan are in full alignment. And that's plan are in full alignment. And that's plan are in full alignment. And that's really important especially when we're really important especially when we're really important especially when we're going to be spinning up multiple agents going to be spinning up multiple agents going to be spinning up multiple agents because of course that's going to come because of course that's going to come because of course that's going to come with some added costs and we don't want with some added costs and we don't want with some added costs and we don't want to, you know, spin our wheels and waste to, you know, spin our wheels and waste to, you know, spin our wheels and waste our time and waste our money on having our time and waste our money on having our time and waste our money on having an incorrect plan from the outset. In an incorrect plan from the outset. In an incorrect plan from the outset. In this case, we'll be using cursors plan this case, we'll be using cursors plan this case, we'll be using cursors plan mode, which I I think has gotten mode, which I I think has gotten mode, which I I think has gotten actually a lot better. I like it a lot. actually a lot better. I like it a lot. actually a lot better. I like it a lot. So, I'm going to switch this to plan So, I'm going to switch this to plan So, I'm going to switch this to plan mode. And of course, you could use mode. And of course, you could use mode. And of course, you could use something like agent OS that does a something like agent OS that does a something like agent OS that does a really good job of developing even more really good job of developing even more really good job of developing even more in-depth specs and task lists. But in-depth specs and task lists. But in-depth specs and task lists. But cursors, plan mode works works pretty cursors, plan mode works works pretty cursors, plan mode works works pretty well. And I also find that sonnet 4.5 is well. And I also find that sonnet 4.5 is well. And I also find that sonnet 4.5 is a little bit better at planning big bu a little bit better at planning big bu a little bit better at planning big bu build builds and also uh asking really build builds and also uh asking really build builds and also uh asking really uh smart clarifying questions. Composer uh smart clarifying questions. Composer uh smart clarifying questions. Composer is okay with that but not quite as good is okay with that but not quite as good is okay with that but not quite as good as sonnet. I think that's sort of the as sonnet. I think that's sort of the as sonnet. I think that's sort of the case in general across the board. Sonnet case in general across the board. Sonnet case in general across the board. Sonnet 4.5 is still my go-to model for most 4.5 is still my go-to model for most 4.5 is still my go-to model for most things but man that that speed from things but man that that speed from things but man that that speed from composer is unreal. Okay, so we're going composer is unreal. Okay, so we're going composer is unreal. Okay, so we're going to start with just one one single agent to start with just one one single agent to start with just one one single agent creating a plan and then we'll get into creating a plan and then we'll get into creating a plan and then we'll get into spinning up three agents to build out spinning up three agents to build out spinning up three agents to build out the plan. Okay, so I'm going to answer the plan. Okay, so I'm going to answer the plan. Okay, so I'm going to answer these uh clarifying questions. Okay, so these uh clarifying questions. Okay, so these uh clarifying questions. Okay, so I'm just going to review this plan I'm just going to review this plan I'm just going to review this plan before we get started. And again, this before we get started. And again, this before we get started. And again, this is a really important step to make sure is a really important step to make sure is a really important step to make sure that we're on the same page and that that we're on the same page and that that we're on the same page and that we're going to give all three agents uh we're going to give all three agents uh we're going to give all three agents uh the right instructions uh to kind of try the right instructions uh to kind of try the right instructions uh to kind of try to set them up for success. We're going to set them up for success. We're going to set them up for success. We're going to build this out on the homepage. We're to build this out on the homepage. We're to build this out on the homepage. We're going to display some weather data. going to display some weather data. going to display some weather data. We'll have a responsive layout. I think We'll have a responsive layout. I think We'll have a responsive layout. I think this is looking good. And we have a this is looking good. And we have a this is looking good. And we have a pretty simple uh to-do list that cursor pretty simple uh to-do list that cursor pretty simple uh to-do list that cursor uh set up for us. Okay, so that is good. uh set up for us. Okay, so that is good. uh set up for us. Okay, so that is good. Now, let's go ahead and start building Now, let's go ahead and start building Now, let's go ahead and start building this. I'm going to start a new agent. this. I'm going to start a new agent. this. I'm going to start a new agent. And so, now here is where we're going to And so, now here is where we're going to And so, now here is where we're going to spin up multiple agents to build the spin up multiple agents to build the spin up multiple agents to build the same thing. So, first of all, let's just same thing. So, first of all, let's just same thing. So, first of all, let's just mention this this plan. I'll just say mention this this plan. I'll just say mention this this plan. I'll just say build this. That's probably not even build this. That's probably not even build this. That's probably not even necessary, but just sort of a habit. So, necessary, but just sort of a habit. So, necessary, but just sort of a habit. So, I am referencing this plan in the prompt I am referencing this plan in the prompt I am referencing this plan in the prompt itself. And then we're going to come itself. And then we're going to come itself. And then we're going to come here and select the model and we'll go here and select the model and we'll go here and select the model and we'll go to use multiple models. So this is how to use multiple models. So this is how to use multiple models. So this is how we can start to uh spin up multiple we can start to uh spin up multiple we can start to uh spin up multiple agents. As you can see, I have three agents. As you can see, I have three agents. As you can see, I have three models checked here. We have one for models checked here. We have one for models checked here. We have one for composer one. That is cursor's new composer one. That is cursor's new composer one. That is cursor's new model. We're going to use that as one of model. We're going to use that as one of model. We're going to use that as one of them. We'll use Sonnet 4.5. That's them. We'll use Sonnet 4.5. That's them. We'll use Sonnet 4.5. That's really my go-to in general for for most really my go-to in general for for most really my go-to in general for for most things. Uh, I still think it's just things. Uh, I still think it's just things. Uh, I still think it's just slightly better in terms of quality and slightly better in terms of quality and slightly better in terms of quality and capability than all the all the rest of capability than all the all the rest of capability than all the all the rest of the models right now, but composer one the models right now, but composer one the models right now, but composer one is just so much faster that that adds a is just so much faster that that adds a is just so much faster that that adds a lot of value as well. And it's very lot of value as well. And it's very lot of value as well. And it's very close in in quality in my experience so close in in quality in my experience so close in in quality in my experience so far. And then in the third agent, we'll far. And then in the third agent, we'll far. And then in the third agent, we'll try GPT5 codeex, which I also think is try GPT5 codeex, which I also think is try GPT5 codeex, which I also think is pretty good, and I go to that sometimes. pretty good, and I go to that sometimes. pretty good, and I go to that sometimes. Yeah. And also, you know, we have one X Yeah. And also, you know, we have one X Yeah. And also, you know, we have one X set for each of these. I could go in set for each of these. I could go in set for each of these. I could go in here and multiply it and have like two here and multiply it and have like two here and multiply it and have like two different set 4.5s and and two composer different set 4.5s and and two composer different set 4.5s and and two composer ones and every single agent is going to ones and every single agent is going to ones and every single agent is going to have a slightly different uh result, a have a slightly different uh result, a have a slightly different uh result, a different take on this prompt. That's different take on this prompt. That's different take on this prompt. That's the nature of large language models. Uh the nature of large language models. Uh the nature of large language models. Uh but they all will be working off of the but they all will be working off of the but they all will be working off of the same plan and we're going to start them same plan and we're going to start them same plan and we're going to start them off all at the same time and we're going off all at the same time and we're going off all at the same time and we're going to see how they work uh side by side. to see how they work uh side by side. to see how they work uh side by side. Let's go ahead and do that now. Okay. So Let's go ahead and do that now. Okay. So Let's go ahead and do that now. Okay. So now we have uh this nice interface here. now we have uh this nice interface here. now we have uh this nice interface here. You know, one, two, three. I can easily You know, one, two, three. I can easily You know, one, two, three. I can easily tab between them. I do wish that cursor tab between them. I do wish that cursor tab between them. I do wish that cursor would have a little bit better keyboard would have a little bit better keyboard would have a little bit better keyboard navigation with these. I I hope that navigation with these. I I hope that navigation with these. I I hope that that comes along because I like to have that comes along because I like to have that comes along because I like to have everything available on the keyboard and everything available on the keyboard and everything available on the keyboard and so far I haven't found an easy way to so far I haven't found an easy way to so far I haven't found an easy way to bind these to a key mapping. Wow. I mean bind these to a key mapping. Wow. I mean bind these to a key mapping. Wow. I mean composer one is is already actually composer one is is already actually composer one is is already actually finished and uh in set 4.5 is still uh finished and uh in set 4.5 is still uh finished and uh in set 4.5 is still uh zero of three to-dos. Looks like codeex zero of three to-dos. Looks like codeex zero of three to-dos. Looks like codeex is sort of asking for permission to is sort of asking for permission to is sort of asking for permission to proceed and I'm just going to say proceed and I'm just going to say proceed and I'm just going to say proceed. Now, by the way, before we proceed. Now, by the way, before we proceed. Now, by the way, before we start uh reviewing the code, let me just start uh reviewing the code, let me just start uh reviewing the code, let me just show you exactly what's going on because show you exactly what's going on because show you exactly what's going on because it could be really confusing when we're it could be really confusing when we're it could be really confusing when we're using git work trees. Like where are all using git work trees. Like where are all using git work trees. Like where are all these agents actually making edits to these agents actually making edits to these agents actually making edits to which files and where do they actually which files and where do they actually which files and where do they actually live on our system? So, to make this live on our system? So, to make this live on our system? So, to make this clear, I always like to open up finder clear, I always like to open up finder clear, I always like to open up finder and just sort of like get oriented with and just sort of like get oriented with and just sort of like get oriented with what we're actually looking at here. So, what we're actually looking at here. So, what we're actually looking at here. So, on the left side, I'm looking at my on the left side, I'm looking at my on the left side, I'm looking at my actual project. That's we called it actual project. That's we called it actual project. That's we called it weatheroo. And here is the rails app. weatheroo. And here is the rails app. weatheroo. And here is the rails app. these files. If I go back in here and I these files. If I go back in here and I these files. If I go back in here and I go into editor mode, these files right go into editor mode, these files right go into editor mode, these files right here, that is the like the Rails here, that is the like the Rails here, that is the like the Rails application that I've already spun up application that I've already spun up application that I've already spun up for this project. But none of these for this project. But none of these for this project. But none of these three agents actually have made any three agents actually have made any three agents actually have made any edits on our core Rails app. So for edits on our core Rails app. So for edits on our core Rails app. So for example, if I look at it in the browser example, if I look at it in the browser example, if I look at it in the browser right now, I still see my default hello right now, I still see my default hello right now, I still see my default hello world root page. So I'm not yet seeing world root page. So I'm not yet seeing world root page. So I'm not yet seeing any of the work from any of the agents, any of the work from any of the agents, any of the work from any of the agents, right? So where is that that work right? So where is that that work right? So where is that that work actually being done? Well, if I open up actually being done? Well, if I open up actually being done? Well, if I open up Finder again over here on the right Finder again over here on the right Finder again over here on the right side, I go into my system level and then side, I go into my system level and then side, I go into my system level and then I'll go into the cursor folder. That's a I'll go into the cursor folder. That's a I'll go into the cursor folder. That's a hidden folder on your system. Then go hidden folder on your system. Then go hidden folder on your system. Then go into work trees and then you'll see a into work trees and then you'll see a into work trees and then you'll see a folder that was automatically created folder that was automatically created folder that was automatically created matching the same name as the project. matching the same name as the project. matching the same name as the project. In this case, it's weatheroo. And then In this case, it's weatheroo. And then In this case, it's weatheroo. And then in there, I have three folders with in there, I have three folders with in there, I have three folders with these sort of like random code names. these sort of like random code names. these sort of like random code names. Each of these is a work tree. So, a git Each of these is a work tree. So, a git Each of these is a work tree. So, a git work tree is a complete replica. It's a work tree is a complete replica. It's a work tree is a complete replica. It's a complete copy of your entire codebase. complete copy of your entire codebase. complete copy of your entire codebase. All the files, all the folders, they get All the files, all the folders, they get All the files, all the folders, they get copied into their own respective folders copied into their own respective folders copied into their own respective folders here. So each of these folders here. So each of these folders here. So each of these folders corresponds to each of these agents. So corresponds to each of these agents. So corresponds to each of these agents. So in agent mode, I can toggle between them in agent mode, I can toggle between them in agent mode, I can toggle between them here. And that's exactly the same as in here. And that's exactly the same as in here. And that's exactly the same as in editor mode. Now, running multiple editor mode. Now, running multiple editor mode. Now, running multiple agents with git work trees isn't new. agents with git work trees isn't new. agents with git work trees isn't new. And I did a video on this with Claude And I did a video on this with Claude And I did a video on this with Claude Code months ago, but the process was Code months ago, but the process was Code months ago, but the process was complicated, unintuitive, and I had to complicated, unintuitive, and I had to complicated, unintuitive, and I had to whip up a script to make it easier. It whip up a script to make it easier. It whip up a script to make it easier. It was kind of a pain. Cursor 2.0 makes it was kind of a pain. Cursor 2.0 makes it was kind of a pain. Cursor 2.0 makes it simple. Multiple agents working simple. Multiple agents working simple. Multiple agents working simultaneously on different branches all simultaneously on different branches all simultaneously on different branches all managed through a clean interface. Okay, managed through a clean interface. Okay, managed through a clean interface. Okay, so uh let's see how we did. So here is so uh let's see how we did. So here is so uh let's see how we did. So here is how you can actually preview the work of how you can actually preview the work of how you can actually preview the work of each of the individual agents and each of the individual agents and each of the individual agents and compare the results one by one. So you compare the results one by one. So you compare the results one by one. So you can do this in either mode, agent mode can do this in either mode, agent mode can do this in either mode, agent mode or editor mode. Let's go into editor or editor mode. Let's go into editor or editor mode. Let's go into editor mode here. And we can pick an agent. mode here. And we can pick an agent. mode here. And we can pick an agent. Let's start with Sonnet 4.5. So it looks Let's start with Sonnet 4.5. So it looks Let's start with Sonnet 4.5. So it looks like all three of them are complete now. like all three of them are complete now. like all three of them are complete now. And again, by default, the main branch And again, by default, the main branch And again, by default, the main branch is still showing our default uh hello is still showing our default uh hello is still showing our default uh hello world page. So I'm going to go ahead and world page. So I'm going to go ahead and world page. So I'm going to go ahead and apply all from the sonnet 4.5 agent. And apply all from the sonnet 4.5 agent. And apply all from the sonnet 4.5 agent. And I can see that I have because now it I can see that I have because now it I can see that I have because now it says reapply. So if I refresh here. says reapply. So if I refresh here. says reapply. So if I refresh here. Okay, so we're getting a failed to fetch Okay, so we're getting a failed to fetch Okay, so we're getting a failed to fetch location name and I'm seeing some some location name and I'm seeing some some location name and I'm seeing some some errors in the console there. So, that's errors in the console there. So, that's errors in the console there. So, that's an issue and maybe we'll we'll work an issue and maybe we'll we'll work an issue and maybe we'll we'll work through that. But before we do, let's through that. But before we do, let's through that. But before we do, let's see how the other agents did. Let's see how the other agents did. Let's see how the other agents did. Let's undo. Now, what that did was it it sort undo. Now, what that did was it it sort undo. Now, what that did was it it sort of pulled those changes back and now of pulled those changes back and now of pulled those changes back and now we're back to our our original state. we're back to our our original state. we're back to our our original state. So, now let's flip over to the middle So, now let's flip over to the middle So, now let's flip over to the middle agent composer one. So, here let's apply agent composer one. So, here let's apply agent composer one. So, here let's apply that. And this one's having trouble as that. And this one's having trouble as that. And this one's having trouble as well. If we retry. Okay, so we're well. If we retry. Okay, so we're well. If we retry. Okay, so we're getting some looks like some corores getting some looks like some corores getting some looks like some corores errors. Okay, maybe third time is a errors. Okay, maybe third time is a errors. Okay, maybe third time is a charm. Let's see uh how we did with uh charm. Let's see uh how we did with uh charm. Let's see uh how we did with uh GPT5 codeex. I'm going to apply that GPT5 codeex. I'm going to apply that GPT5 codeex. I'm going to apply that one. By the way, I I undid the composer one. By the way, I I undid the composer one. By the way, I I undid the composer one first. Went over to GPT5 and I one first. Went over to GPT5 and I one first. Went over to GPT5 and I applied that. And so now, okay, so this applied that. And so now, okay, so this applied that. And so now, okay, so this is actually loading. Okay, so this is is actually loading. Okay, so this is is actually loading. Okay, so this is actually working. This is um this is my actually working. This is um this is my actually working. This is um this is my actual temperature and weather at my actual temperature and weather at my actual temperature and weather at my current location. I see my next 24 current location. I see my next 24 current location. I see my next 24 hours. That's pretty good. I've got a hours. That's pretty good. I've got a hours. That's pretty good. I've got a 7-day forecast. I actually really like 7-day forecast. I actually really like 7-day forecast. I actually really like the design. It's nice and clean. Let's the design. It's nice and clean. Let's the design. It's nice and clean. Let's see how we did with like a mobile layout see how we did with like a mobile layout see how we did with like a mobile layout if we collapse it down. Okay, not bad. I if we collapse it down. Okay, not bad. I if we collapse it down. Okay, not bad. I don't love like the current location don't love like the current location don't love like the current location coordinates. I'd like it to actually coordinates. I'd like it to actually coordinates. I'd like it to actually show my city name. So, maybe that could show my city name. So, maybe that could show my city name. So, maybe that could be like an edit that we would that we be like an edit that we would that we be like an edit that we would that we would roll with. But GPT5 Codeex, I I would roll with. But GPT5 Codeex, I I would roll with. But GPT5 Codeex, I I would not have guessed that that one had would not have guessed that that one had would not have guessed that that one had the best first draft out of uh out of the best first draft out of uh out of the best first draft out of uh out of these three. But you know what? I bet these three. But you know what? I bet these three. But you know what? I bet it's something probably sort of simple it's something probably sort of simple it's something probably sort of simple to fix these errors. So, let's go undo to fix these errors. So, let's go undo to fix these errors. So, let's go undo that. Let's go back to the composer one that. Let's go back to the composer one that. Let's go back to the composer one version and I will apply that one. So, version and I will apply that one. So, version and I will apply that one. So, now we're back on this version which is now we're back on this version which is now we're back on this version which is showing an error. Let's see if we can showing an error. Let's see if we can showing an error. Let's see if we can get this working. So, I'm going to get this working. So, I'm going to get this working. So, I'm going to screenshot all of this and I'm using screenshot all of this and I'm using screenshot all of this and I'm using CleanShot for that on the Mac which I CleanShot for that on the Mac which I CleanShot for that on the Mac which I love. Drop that in here and you know we love. Drop that in here and you know we love. Drop that in here and you know we have the composer agent activated and uh have the composer agent activated and uh have the composer agent activated and uh let's just you know give it that and see let's just you know give it that and see let's just you know give it that and see if we can get this working. Okay. So, if we can get this working. Okay. So, if we can get this working. Okay. So, there we go. Uh, it was able to to fix there we go. Uh, it was able to to fix there we go. Uh, it was able to to fix that. So, now we have this is the that. So, now we have this is the that. So, now we have this is the version from Composer 1, which is very version from Composer 1, which is very version from Composer 1, which is very nice. I like it. Uh, a lot lighter. Um, nice. I like it. Uh, a lot lighter. Um, nice. I like it. Uh, a lot lighter. Um, this one is actually showing my town. I this one is actually showing my town. I this one is actually showing my town. I live here in in Orange, Connecticut. live here in in Orange, Connecticut. live here in in Orange, Connecticut. This is uh the weather here. This is the This is uh the weather here. This is the This is uh the weather here. This is the 24hour forecast. I've got my 7-day 24hour forecast. I've got my 7-day 24hour forecast. I've got my 7-day forecast. Let's see how we did on the forecast. Let's see how we did on the forecast. Let's see how we did on the responsive layout. Okay, not bad. Yeah, responsive layout. Okay, not bad. Yeah, responsive layout. Okay, not bad. Yeah, that works. I didn't ask it to do a dark that works. I didn't ask it to do a dark that works. I didn't ask it to do a dark mode, but let's see if it handled that. mode, but let's see if it handled that. mode, but let's see if it handled that. No, it did not. Okay. Yeah. Uh it, you No, it did not. Okay. Yeah. Uh it, you No, it did not. Okay. Yeah. Uh it, you know, it basically built everything that know, it basically built everything that know, it basically built everything that I wanted it. Okay. So, now over on I wanted it. Okay. So, now over on I wanted it. Okay. So, now over on Sonnet, I actually did uh have it, you Sonnet, I actually did uh have it, you Sonnet, I actually did uh have it, you know, fix the error there and uh I know, fix the error there and uh I know, fix the error there and uh I reloaded and now Sonnet 4.5. This is reloaded and now Sonnet 4.5. This is reloaded and now Sonnet 4.5. This is what it came up with. This is now what it came up with. This is now what it came up with. This is now working. Although, I must say I'm not as working. Although, I must say I'm not as working. Although, I must say I'm not as happy with the overall design. And it happy with the overall design. And it happy with the overall design. And it has that very typical sort of vibe has that very typical sort of vibe has that very typical sort of vibe coded, you know, big rounded corners, coded, you know, big rounded corners, coded, you know, big rounded corners, lots of drop shadows kind of kind of lots of drop shadows kind of kind of lots of drop shadows kind of kind of vibe. So, uh, yeah, but it it does work. vibe. So, uh, yeah, but it it does work. vibe. So, uh, yeah, but it it does work. It's got the weather. It's got my my It's got the weather. It's got my my It's got the weather. It's got my my hourly forecast. 7-day. Let's see. hourly forecast. 7-day. Let's see. hourly forecast. 7-day. Let's see. Refresh weather. Nice little loading Refresh weather. Nice little loading Refresh weather. Nice little loading animation. It doesn't have my actual animation. It doesn't have my actual animation. It doesn't have my actual location name, so that's probably location name, so that's probably location name, so that's probably something that could be fixed. Yeah. So, something that could be fixed. Yeah. So, something that could be fixed. Yeah. So, I reapplied the composer agents work, I reapplied the composer agents work, I reapplied the composer agents work, and I think I like this the best. It has and I think I like this the best. It has and I think I like this the best. It has all the functionality that I would need. all the functionality that I would need. all the functionality that I would need. Although I must say I did like the Although I must say I did like the Although I must say I did like the design work from the GPT5 codeex one. So design work from the GPT5 codeex one. So design work from the GPT5 codeex one. So that was pretty nice. My next step at that was pretty nice. My next step at that was pretty nice. My next step at this stage would be to choose one and this stage would be to choose one and this stage would be to choose one and then keep working off of that. So for then keep working off of that. So for then keep working off of that. So for example, I think that this one with example, I think that this one with example, I think that this one with composer one actually ended up being, composer one actually ended up being, composer one actually ended up being, you know, like the the best one to work you know, like the the best one to work you know, like the the best one to work with. You know, just as an example, my with. You know, just as an example, my with. You know, just as an example, my next step might be to add like a dark next step might be to add like a dark next step might be to add like a dark mode. So let's go ahead and see if it mode. So let's go ahead and see if it mode. So let's go ahead and see if it can uh see if it can do that. Please can uh see if it can do that. Please can uh see if it can do that. Please automatically support both light mode automatically support both light mode automatically support both light mode and dark mode. and include a toggle and dark mode. and include a toggle and dark mode. and include a toggle switch at the top for the user to switch switch at the top for the user to switch switch at the top for the user to switch between them. between them. between them. I'm just having so much fun watching the I'm just having so much fun watching the I'm just having so much fun watching the composer one agent work. I mean, just composer one agent work. I mean, just composer one agent work. I mean, just look at how fast it is actually look at how fast it is actually look at how fast it is actually implementing these changes. It's implementing these changes. It's implementing these changes. It's unbelievable to me. unbelievable to me. unbelievable to me. Done. Okay, so we have our little uh Done. Okay, so we have our little uh Done. Okay, so we have our little uh switcher up there. Nice. We've got dark switcher up there. Nice. We've got dark switcher up there. Nice. We've got dark mode and light mode. That works. I like mode and light mode. That works. I like mode and light mode. That works. I like it. Now, running parallel agents it. Now, running parallel agents it. Now, running parallel agents multiplies your costs, of course, and multiplies your costs, of course, and multiplies your costs, of course, and that's why I tend to be more selective that's why I tend to be more selective that's why I tend to be more selective in using this feature. I use it for more in using this feature. I use it for more in using this feature. I use it for more complex critical builds where the complex critical builds where the complex critical builds where the productivity gain justifies the costs. productivity gain justifies the costs. productivity gain justifies the costs. So, the team at Cursor clearly So, the team at Cursor clearly So, the team at Cursor clearly understands our two different modes of understands our two different modes of understands our two different modes of working and they built that right into working and they built that right into working and they built that right into their product, which I love. So, I their product, which I love. So, I their product, which I love. So, I really do think that this Cursor 2.0 really do think that this Cursor 2.0 really do think that this Cursor 2.0 update represents a real turning point update represents a real turning point update represents a real turning point in how we build. And it's been quite a in how we build. And it's been quite a in how we build. And it's been quite a year when it comes to how our workflow year when it comes to how our workflow year when it comes to how our workflow as builders keeps evolving. And you as builders keeps evolving. And you as builders keeps evolving. And you know, specdriven development is one of know, specdriven development is one of know, specdriven development is one of those new paradigms that I've talked a those new paradigms that I've talked a those new paradigms that I've talked a lot about on this channel, and I think lot about on this channel, and I think lot about on this channel, and I think it's still relevant, especially in agent it's still relevant, especially in agent it's still relevant, especially in agent mode in cursor 2.0. So, if you're not mode in cursor 2.0. So, if you're not mode in cursor 2.0. So, if you're not familiar with spec driven development, familiar with spec driven development, familiar with spec driven development, then I want you to see my other video on then I want you to see my other video on then I want you to see my other video on how spec driven development works in the how spec driven development works in the how spec driven development works in the real world.

Cursor AI significantly reduces development time, accomplishing tasks in 30 minutes that would typically take a junior engineer two weeks.\n2. Ensuring responsiveness across all devices (tablet, mobile, desktop) is a crucial aspect of frontend development.\n3. The traditional method of ensuring app responsiveness involved manually reviewing the app across various devices and screen sizes.\n4. Cursor 2.0 introduces a new workflow that simplifies the process of making apps responsive on different devices, making it highly efficient for frontend development.\n5. The process requires using specific browser features, with Google Chrome being highlighted as the preferred option for this workflow.\n6. The Cursor 2.0 AI tool is still in its early stages, with some features being a bit buggy and expected to improve over time.\n7. Despite some current limitations, Cursor 2.0 aims to streamline frontend development by automating responsiveness adjustments, which traditionally required significant manual effort.\n\n--- Full Transcript ---\nThe workflow I'm about to show you right The workflow I'm about to show you right now in cursor AI, if I would have now in cursor AI, if I would have now in cursor AI, if I would have associated this to a junior engineer, associated this to a junior engineer, associated this to a junior engineer, would have taken them around two weeks would have taken them around two weeks would have taken them around two weeks to do. Let me show you how to do it to do. Let me show you how to do it to do. Let me show you how to do it under 30 minutes. For anyone that under 30 minutes. For anyone that under 30 minutes. For anyone that develops frontends knows that one of the develops frontends knows that one of the develops frontends knows that one of the most important things that you need to most important things that you need to most important things that you need to do is ensure responsiveness on all do is ensure responsiveness on all do is ensure responsiveness on all devices, tablet, mobile, desktop. And devices, tablet, mobile, desktop. And devices, tablet, mobile, desktop. And the way we would approach this is we the way we would approach this is we the way we would approach this is we would right click here, you'd hit would right click here, you'd hit would right click here, you'd hit inspect for context. This is on Chrome. inspect for context. This is on Chrome. inspect for context. This is on Chrome. You'd come up here to devices, You'd come up here to devices, You'd come up here to devices, click it, and this would allow you to click it, and this would allow you to click it, and this would allow you to move this bar to go back and forth the move this bar to go back and forth the move this bar to go back and forth the different screen sizes. In addition, we different screen sizes. In addition, we different screen sizes. In addition, we can call you to dimensions and we get can call you to dimensions and we get can call you to dimensions and we get very specific metrics on the different very specific metrics on the different very specific metrics on the different devices you can put this on. Eg iPad Pro devices you can put this on. Eg iPad Pro devices you can put this on. Eg iPad Pro Surface Duo. In the old way of coding, I Surface Duo. In the old way of coding, I Surface Duo. In the old way of coding, I would have needed to manually review the would have needed to manually review the would have needed to manually review the entire responsiveness of my app. But now entire responsiveness of my app. But now entire responsiveness of my app. But now with Cursor 2.0 and this new agent with Cursor 2.0 and this new agent with Cursor 2.0 and this new agent workflow, this is probably one of the workflow, this is probably one of the workflow, this is probably one of the most impressive things I've seen most impressive things I've seen most impressive things I've seen specific to front-end development. Let's specific to front-end development. Let's specific to front-end development. Let's check it out. So, as we know on mobile, check it out. So, as we know on mobile, check it out. So, as we know on mobile, iPad, and desktop, we need to change how iPad, and desktop, we need to change how iPad, and desktop, we need to change how our underlying UI looks like to look our underlying UI looks like to look our underlying UI looks like to look better. a desktop version of your app better. a desktop version of your app better. a desktop version of your app can't be your mobile version of the app. can't be your mobile version of the app. can't be your mobile version of the app. That's why a very simple way typically That's why a very simple way typically That's why a very simple way typically to do this is to do columns to do this is to do columns to do this is to do columns alternatively to rows in the code. And alternatively to rows in the code. And alternatively to rows in the code. And if you know this, then to prompt the AI if you know this, then to prompt the AI if you know this, then to prompt the AI model to do it for you is a lot simpler model to do it for you is a lot simpler model to do it for you is a lot simpler than you think. And it requires this than you think. And it requires this than you think. And it requires this browser feature and specifically Google browser feature and specifically Google browser feature and specifically Google Chrome to be selected. Now, what I want Chrome to be selected. Now, what I want Chrome to be selected. Now, what I want you to understand real quick is that the you to understand real quick is that the you to understand real quick is that the browser tab is hit or miss right now. browser tab is hit or miss right now. browser tab is hit or miss right now. Cursy 2.0 just came out. So by the time Cursy 2.0 just came out. So by the time Cursy 2.0 just came out. So by the time you use the browser tab feature, it you use the browser tab feature, it you use the browser tab feature, it might be absolutely perfect. But in the might be absolutely perfect. But in the might be absolutely perfect. But in the short term, this feature is a little bit short term, this feature is a little bit short term, this feature is a little bit buggy. So it's not a U thing. It's a buggy. So it's not a U thing. It's a buggy. So it's not a U thing. It's a cursor AI 2.0 thing. Chrome though is cursor AI 2.0 thing. Chrome though is cursor AI 2.0 thing. Chrome though is just going to open up the relevant just going to open up the relevant just going to open up the relevant browser into a separate tab. So I'm browser into a separate tab. So I'm browser into a separate tab. So I'm going to be looking for this localhost going to be looking for this localhost going to be looking for this localhost 3000 to be open. And I'm going to first 3000 to be open. And I'm going to first 3000 to be open. And I'm going to first identify with my little agent here that identify with my little agent here that identify with my little agent here that you can see it. So typically what I like you can see it. So typically what I like you can see it. So typically what I like to do is start the workflow with ask. I to do is start the workflow with ask. I to do is start the workflow with ask. I don't want it to just shoot off and don't want it to just shoot off and don't want it to just shoot off and start working. The typical terminology start working. The typical terminology start working. The typical terminology you want to use is navigate to localhost you want to use is navigate to localhost you want to use is navigate to localhost 3000. Ensure that the browser feature is 3000. Ensure that the browser feature is 3000. Ensure that the browser feature is on with Google Chrome and hit enter. on with Google Chrome and hit enter. on with Google Chrome and hit enter. This should open up a Google Chrome in This should open up a Google Chrome in This should open up a Google Chrome in incognito on your desktop. Here's the incognito on your desktop. Here's the incognito on your desktop. Here's the first thing that it does that's first thing that it does that's first thing that it does that's extremely annoying where it says it extremely annoying where it says it extremely annoying where it says it can't use the browsing feature. So what can't use the browsing feature. So what can't use the browsing feature. So what I typically do is hit new agent here and I typically do is hit new agent here and I typically do is hit new agent here and I show I show all these errors in my I show I show all these errors in my I show I show all these errors in my videos y'all. So you as a developer can videos y'all. So you as a developer can videos y'all. So you as a developer can see that it's not all just perfect and see that it's not all just perfect and see that it's not all just perfect and cookie cutting. I show how to cookie cutting. I show how to cookie cutting. I show how to troubleshoot on this channel. So make troubleshoot on this channel. So make troubleshoot on this channel. So make sure to subscribe here. Make sure leave sure to subscribe here. Make sure leave sure to subscribe here. Make sure leave a like. I'm going do the exact same a like. I'm going do the exact same a like. I'm going do the exact same prompt. Navigate to enter. And it worked prompt. Navigate to enter. And it worked prompt. Navigate to enter. And it worked this time. So, here we go. As you'll this time. So, here we go. As you'll this time. So, here we go. As you'll notice, it is in incognito mode. Uh, one notice, it is in incognito mode. Uh, one notice, it is in incognito mode. Uh, one thing to take note is that because it's thing to take note is that because it's thing to take note is that because it's in incognito mode, uh, this requires you in incognito mode, uh, this requires you in incognito mode, uh, this requires you if you want to sign into an account for if you want to sign into an account for if you want to sign into an account for your software, like you have to resign your software, like you have to resign your software, like you have to resign in. It's a little frustrating, but they in. It's a little frustrating, but they in. It's a little frustrating, but they do this on purpose for security reasons do this on purpose for security reasons do this on purpose for security reasons because they don't want to basically because they don't want to basically because they don't want to basically give Cursor AI the ability to have a give Cursor AI the ability to have a give Cursor AI the ability to have a logged in browser. They can go to your logged in browser. They can go to your logged in browser. They can go to your Gmail, go to your bank, and everything Gmail, go to your bank, and everything Gmail, go to your bank, and everything of that nature. That's why up here as of that nature. That's why up here as of that nature. That's why up here as well, Chrome is being controlled by an well, Chrome is being controlled by an well, Chrome is being controlled by an automated test software. So, with this automated test software. So, with this automated test software. So, with this open though, I can go ahead and just open though, I can go ahead and just open though, I can go ahead and just expand it. Now that we've identified expand it. Now that we've identified expand it. Now that we've identified that it's open and as you can see from that it's open and as you can see from that it's open and as you can see from the text, lead the llama, the workflow, the text, lead the llama, the workflow, the text, lead the llama, the workflow, leads wardrobe. These are different leads wardrobe. These are different leads wardrobe. These are different components found behind me here. It sees components found behind me here. It sees components found behind me here. It sees it. Watch this prompt. This prompt took it. Watch this prompt. This prompt took it. Watch this prompt. This prompt took me 20 seconds to type. If I were to have me 20 seconds to type. If I were to have me 20 seconds to type. If I were to have to explain the processes and labor to explain the processes and labor to explain the processes and labor associated for responsiveness, this associated for responsiveness, this associated for responsiveness, this would have taken me a 20-minute call would have taken me a 20-minute call would have taken me a 20-minute call with a junior engineer. And then on top with a junior engineer. And then on top with a junior engineer. And then on top of that, this would have taken two to of that, this would have taken two to of that, this would have taken two to three weeks for that junior engineer to three weeks for that junior engineer to three weeks for that junior engineer to confirm the labor. But watch this. Okay. confirm the labor. But watch this. Okay. confirm the labor. But watch this. Okay. Okay, I want you to navigate through my Okay, I want you to navigate through my Okay, I want you to navigate through my entire website, click buttons, and see entire website, click buttons, and see entire website, click buttons, and see all pages. Make sure it looks good on all pages. Make sure it looks good on all pages. Make sure it looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop, and come mobile, tablet, and desktop, and come mobile, tablet, and desktop, and come back to me for report. Don't stop back to me for report. Don't stop back to me for report. Don't stop looking until it's done. Now, typically looking until it's done. Now, typically looking until it's done. Now, typically with these kind of prompts, I would with these kind of prompts, I would with these kind of prompts, I would suggest using ask, but due the fact that suggest using ask, but due the fact that suggest using ask, but due the fact that in order for this to take screenshots in order for this to take screenshots in order for this to take screenshots and navigate through your local host and navigate through your local host and navigate through your local host 3000, it actually requires agent. I'm 3000, it actually requires agent. I'm 3000, it actually requires agent. I'm going to hit enter here. And I don't going to hit enter here. And I don't going to hit enter here. And I don't care how long this takes. I don't care care how long this takes. I don't care care how long this takes. I don't care if this takes 30 minutes. I don't care if this takes 30 minutes. I don't care if this takes 30 minutes. I don't care if this takes 40 minutes because I know if this takes 40 minutes because I know if this takes 40 minutes because I know conceptually if I were to request the conceptually if I were to request the conceptually if I were to request the same exact thing to someone else or I do same exact thing to someone else or I do same exact thing to someone else or I do it myself, this would have taken way it myself, this would have taken way it myself, this would have taken way longer. Look at this y'all. It's going longer. Look at this y'all. It's going longer. Look at this y'all. It's going off. It's clicking through. I come over off. It's clicking through. I come over off. It's clicking through. I come over here. It's no joke. Cursor AI is quite here. It's no joke. Cursor AI is quite here. It's no joke. Cursor AI is quite literally going through my entire literally going through my entire literally going through my entire application right now in desktop. Then application right now in desktop. Then application right now in desktop. Then it's going to switch to tablet and then it's going to switch to tablet and then it's going to switch to tablet and then it's going to switch to mobile. And it's it's going to switch to mobile. And it's it's going to switch to mobile. And it's going to do this all automatically. Just going to do this all automatically. Just going to do this all automatically. Just switch to tablet. It's checking again. switch to tablet. It's checking again. switch to tablet. It's checking again. It's going to do this all automatically. It's going to do this all automatically. It's going to do this all automatically. When I say we're in a new era of coding, When I say we're in a new era of coding, When I say we're in a new era of coding, I'm not joking. The reason why a lot of I'm not joking. The reason why a lot of I'm not joking. The reason why a lot of people don't understand how this is the people don't understand how this is the people don't understand how this is the new age of coding is either they have new age of coding is either they have new age of coding is either they have been so laser tuned into a specific tech been so laser tuned into a specific tech been so laser tuned into a specific tech stack. They don't realize the stack. They don't realize the stack. They don't realize the implications of what this means or implications of what this means or implications of what this means or alternatively they didn't take the time alternatively they didn't take the time alternatively they didn't take the time to realize how big of a deal these kind to realize how big of a deal these kind to realize how big of a deal these kind of workflows really are in software of workflows really are in software of workflows really are in software development. Your next question might be development. Your next question might be development. Your next question might be this is super cool. I want to learn this is super cool. I want to learn this is super cool. I want to learn more. What I'm showing you right now is more. What I'm showing you right now is more. What I'm showing you right now is probably 2% not even 2% I would say probably 2% not even 2% I would say probably 2% not even 2% I would say under a percent of the value I provide under a percent of the value I provide under a percent of the value I provide in another series I'm doing on this in another series I'm doing on this in another series I'm doing on this channel. Let me show you that series. channel. Let me show you that series. channel. Let me show you that series. And if you actually want to take this And if you actually want to take this And if you actually want to take this stuff seriously, I encourage you to stuff seriously, I encourage you to stuff seriously, I encourage you to watch every single video. These are watch every single video. These are watch every single video. These are long, meaty videos, 30 minutes, 50 long, meaty videos, 30 minutes, 50 long, meaty videos, 30 minutes, 50 minutes. Because in reality, for me to minutes. Because in reality, for me to minutes. Because in reality, for me to show you how to really create an show you how to really create an show you how to really create an application for production and make application for production and make application for production and make money, it's going to take hours for you money, it's going to take hours for you money, it's going to take hours for you to learn. But those hours for you to to learn. But those hours for you to to learn. But those hours for you to learn took me years to understand. So learn took me years to understand. So learn took me years to understand. So check out this playlist description down check out this playlist description down check out this playlist description down below. All free. What you'll notice as below. All free. What you'll notice as below. All free. What you'll notice as well is that these agents are extremely well is that these agents are extremely well is that these agents are extremely advanced. They're able to do very advanced. They're able to do very advanced. They're able to do very specific types of commands within specific types of commands within specific types of commands within literally typing on your keyboard. And literally typing on your keyboard. And literally typing on your keyboard. And look at this cursor. Cursor is look at this cursor. Cursor is look at this cursor. Cursor is absolutely beautiful. It wants to give absolutely beautiful. It wants to give absolutely beautiful. It wants to give you another update. Not right now. We're you another update. Not right now. We're you another update. Not right now. We're doing a video. Okay, I'm going to let doing a video. Okay, I'm going to let doing a video. Okay, I'm going to let this run and then I'll tell you how long this run and then I'll tell you how long this run and then I'll tell you how long it took. So, I'll be back. It went ahead it took. So, I'll be back. It went ahead it took. So, I'll be back. It went ahead and compiled a report and it took around and compiled a report and it took around and compiled a report and it took around 6 minutes with this report. I can scroll 6 minutes with this report. I can scroll 6 minutes with this report. I can scroll all the way up. Responsive layout. All all the way up. Responsive layout. All all the way up.

Now, we're not talking about menu. Now, we're not talking about menu. Now, we're not talking about McDonald's, but if you love hamburgers, McDonald's, but if you love hamburgers, McDonald's, but if you love hamburgers, oh, take me to In-N-Out. I love those oh, take me to In-N-Out. I love those oh, take me to In-N-Out. I love those banana peppers. banana peppers. banana peppers. Uh, hamburger menu means when you go Uh, hamburger menu means when you go Uh, hamburger menu means when you go into here and then you see these three into here and then you see these three into here and then you see these three little lines and then it will dive in little lines and then it will dive in little lines and then it will dive in further depending on the page. One thing further depending on the page. One thing further depending on the page. One thing I want to make fundamentally extremely I want to make fundamentally extremely I want to make fundamentally extremely clear here is that when it gives you an clear here is that when it gives you an clear here is that when it gives you an output like that and it says everything output like that and it says everything output like that and it says everything is perfect and everything is like is perfect and everything is like is perfect and everything is like beautiful. It might not be perfect and beautiful. It might not be perfect and beautiful. It might not be perfect and beautiful but that is your role now as beautiful but that is your role now as beautiful but that is your role now as an AI coder. You are the senior an AI coder. You are the senior an AI coder. You are the senior engineer. I have had situations where engineer. I have had situations where engineer. I have had situations where junior engineers gave me code that they junior engineers gave me code that they junior engineers gave me code that they thought was good and it was not good. thought was good and it was not good. thought was good and it was not good. Therefore, I had to review the code. So, Therefore, I had to review the code. So, Therefore, I had to review the code. So, yes, this does require a little bit of yes, this does require a little bit of yes, this does require a little bit of you to go through the front end, you to you to go through the front end, you to you to go through the front end, you to find that little nuance of stuff that find that little nuance of stuff that find that little nuance of stuff that maybe doesn't functionally work on a maybe doesn't functionally work on a maybe doesn't functionally work on a review on this. But what I want you to review on this. But what I want you to review on this. But what I want you to understand is sooner or later, these understand is sooner or later, these understand is sooner or later, these agents are going to be just as good as a agents are going to be just as good as a agents are going to be just as good as a senior engineer. Right now, they're at senior engineer. Right now, they're at senior engineer. Right now, they're at the mindset and mental capability of a the mindset and mental capability of a the mindset and mental capability of a junior engineer. I'm not saying this junior engineer. I'm not saying this junior engineer. I'm not saying this stuff to be disrespectful. I'm just stuff to be disrespectful. I'm just stuff to be disrespectful. I'm just trying to say this stuff. I'm trying to trying to say this stuff. I'm trying to trying to say this stuff. I'm trying to give you context of where we're at right give you context of where we're at right give you context of where we're at right now when it comes to skill. Right now, now when it comes to skill. Right now, now when it comes to skill. Right now, these are like junior engineers. which these are like junior engineers. which these are like junior engineers. which is really good skill, but you still need is really good skill, but you still need is really good skill, but you still need the ability to review the code. And the ability to review the code. And the ability to review the code. And don't worry, you check out that series don't worry, you check out that series don't worry, you check out that series if you want to know how to review the if you want to know how to review the if you want to know how to review the code. Because one thing I found right code. Because one thing I found right code. Because one thing I found right off the bat, if a junior engineer had off the bat, if a junior engineer had off the bat, if a junior engineer had given this to me, and I went ahead and given this to me, and I went ahead and given this to me, and I went ahead and zoomed in a little bit, is I noticed it zoomed in a little bit, is I noticed it zoomed in a little bit, is I noticed it says the hamburger menu worked says the hamburger menu worked says the hamburger menu worked effectively, but in reality, if I click effectively, but in reality, if I click effectively, but in reality, if I click it, nothing happened. I'm not here to it, nothing happened. I'm not here to it, nothing happened. I'm not here to try to clickbait you. I'm not here to try to clickbait you. I'm not here to try to clickbait you. I'm not here to try to sell you a dream. That's an try to sell you a dream. That's an try to sell you a dream. That's an error. That's a mess up. So, what would error. That's a mess up. So, what would error. That's a mess up. So, what would I do in this context? In this context, I do in this context? In this context, I do in this context? In this context, what I would do is I would talk to the what I would do is I would talk to the what I would do is I would talk to the agent like I would a junior engineer and agent like I would a junior engineer and agent like I would a junior engineer and simply put out, hey, yeah, it shrink simply put out, hey, yeah, it shrink simply put out, hey, yeah, it shrink down to a hamburger menu, but the drop down to a hamburger menu, but the drop down to a hamburger menu, but the drop down doesn't work. Therefore, I would down doesn't work. Therefore, I would down doesn't work. Therefore, I would put, okay, after reviewing the hamburger put, okay, after reviewing the hamburger put, okay, after reviewing the hamburger menu shows, but the drop down doesn't menu shows, but the drop down doesn't menu shows, but the drop down doesn't work. Now, where does this translate to work. Now, where does this translate to work. Now, where does this translate to the old way of handling this kind of the old way of handling this kind of the old way of handling this kind of logic? I did a whole 46-minute video logic? I did a whole 46-minute video logic? I did a whole 46-minute video dumbing down GitHub to its absolute dumbing down GitHub to its absolute dumbing down GitHub to its absolute barebones. You can check that out if you barebones. You can check that out if you barebones. You can check that out if you need to understand what GitHub is and need to understand what GitHub is and need to understand what GitHub is and why it's fundamental to software why it's fundamental to software why it's fundamental to software engineering. But the way this would engineering. But the way this would engineering. But the way this would translate in traditional software translate in traditional software translate in traditional software engineering is first, let me just pull engineering is first, let me just pull engineering is first, let me just pull this PR. So we got front end done. Um, this PR. So we got front end done. Um, this PR. So we got front end done. Um, essentially for the series I'm doing, I essentially for the series I'm doing, I essentially for the series I'm doing, I want to finish the entire front end want to finish the entire front end want to finish the entire front end before I jump into the back end. And before I jump into the back end. And before I jump into the back end. And there's reasons behind that. If you want there's reasons behind that. If you want there's reasons behind that. If you want to know the reasons, check out the to know the reasons, check out the to know the reasons, check out the series. All right, front end done. And series. All right, front end done. And series. All right, front end done. And what I usually like to do is like take a what I usually like to do is like take a what I usually like to do is like take a real quick screenshot just for the front real quick screenshot just for the front real quick screenshot just for the front end. Nice. Drag it in there. Create pull end. Nice. Drag it in there. Create pull end. Nice. Drag it in there. Create pull request. So typically what would have request. So typically what would have request. So typically what would have occurred here if let's say I'm the occurred here if let's say I'm the occurred here if let's say I'm the junior engineer, I would have created junior engineer, I would have created junior engineer, I would have created the PR here. I would have hit reviewers the PR here. I would have hit reviewers the PR here. I would have hit reviewers here and then select the senior engineer here and then select the senior engineer here and then select the senior engineer to check the code. Obviously, if you're to check the code. Obviously, if you're to check the code. Obviously, if you're a team alone, if you're numa, you're a team alone, if you're numa, you're a team alone, if you're numa, you're just ins then it's just going to be you. just ins then it's just going to be you. just ins then it's just going to be you.

I would have put in as a comment here I would have put in as a comment here I would have put in as a comment here for the engineer to look at. In addition for the engineer to look at. In addition for the engineer to look at. In addition to this, I would have DM the engineer to this, I would have DM the engineer to this, I would have DM the engineer directly on Slack to let them know that directly on Slack to let them know that directly on Slack to let them know that most of the PR is correct. But here is a most of the PR is correct. But here is a most of the PR is correct. But here is a glitch that I found. For everyone that's glitch that I found. For everyone that's glitch that I found. For everyone that's already watching the series, I'm sorry already watching the series, I'm sorry already watching the series, I'm sorry for keep shouting it out, but y'all got for keep shouting it out, but y'all got for keep shouting it out, but y'all got to understand that not a lot of people to understand that not a lot of people to understand that not a lot of people even know this is happening right now. even know this is happening right now. even know this is happening right now. But in this series that I keep harping But in this series that I keep harping But in this series that I keep harping on in the description down below, Google on in the description down below, Google on in the description down below, Google AI studio to vibe code your entire AI studio to vibe code your entire AI studio to vibe code your entire software. We're going over everything, software. We're going over everything, software. We're going over everything, y'all. The tech stack, app UI, app y'all. The tech stack, app UI, app y'all. The tech stack, app UI, app value, sign up, database functions, and value, sign up, database functions, and value, sign up, database functions, and I'm showing this from a real I'm showing this from a real I'm showing this from a real perspective. I'm going to go ahead and perspective. I'm going to go ahead and perspective. I'm going to go ahead and link another video at the end of this link another video at the end of this link another video at the end of this one that goes over the power of the one that goes over the power of the one that goes over the power of the multi- aent feature and running them in multi- aent feature and running them in multi- aent feature and running them in parallel as yeah, right now this is parallel as yeah, right now this is parallel as yeah, right now this is fixing the hamburger situation, but fixing the hamburger situation, but fixing the hamburger situation, but there's no reason I can't shoot off there's no reason I can't shoot off there's no reason I can't shoot off another additional three to four agents another additional three to four agents another additional three to four agents to handle other issues or adding other to handle other issues or adding other to handle other issues or adding other UI elements found within your software. UI elements found within your software. UI elements found within your software. So, I'm going to let this keep So, I'm going to let this keep So, I'm going to let this keep generating here and we'll see the final generating here and we'll see the final generating here and we'll see the final product. Right now, we're coming to the product. Right now, we're coming to the product. Right now, we're coming to the finish line for that hamburger request finish line for that hamburger request finish line for that hamburger request and making sure mobile navigation works and making sure mobile navigation works and making sure mobile navigation works correctly. One thing I want you to look correctly. One thing I want you to look correctly. One thing I want you to look at is how intuitive this is. This is at is how intuitive this is. This is at is how intuitive this is. This is doing testing that a real engineer would doing testing that a real engineer would doing testing that a real engineer would have done anyways. So, for example, have done anyways. So, for example, have done anyways. So, for example, testing a few more drop down items than testing a few more drop down items than testing a few more drop down items than verifying the final implementation. What verifying the final implementation. What verifying the final implementation. What I want you to notice is that it I want you to notice is that it I want you to notice is that it navigates to click the menu button and navigates to click the menu button and navigates to click the menu button and then it is clicking the pricing on the then it is clicking the pricing on the then it is clicking the pricing on the navigation button in order to ensure navigation button in order to ensure navigation button in order to ensure that on the UI behind me, it is shot that on the UI behind me, it is shot that on the UI behind me, it is shot down to pricing. These are kind of tests down to pricing. These are kind of tests down to pricing. These are kind of tests that we used to have to do personally. that we used to have to do personally. that we used to have to do personally. The AI is so smart now that it's able to The AI is so smart now that it's able to The AI is so smart now that it's able to get the image context to know whether or get the image context to know whether or get the image context to know whether or not if I click pricing, it goes to the not if I click pricing, it goes to the not if I click pricing, it goes to the pricing section on the landing page. And pricing section on the landing page. And pricing section on the landing page. And when it's done doing its work, awaiting when it's done doing its work, awaiting when it's done doing its work, awaiting review, and then what I need to do is as review, and then what I need to do is as review, and then what I need to do is as the role of the senior engineer is the role of the senior engineer is the role of the senior engineer is simply review its work. So I scroll this simply review its work. So I scroll this simply review its work. So I scroll this down here. You know, maybe on tablet down here. You know, maybe on tablet down here. You know, maybe on tablet I'll make this look a little bit better. I'll make this look a little bit better. I'll make this look a little bit better. Maybe I'll hide one of these. But let's Maybe I'll hide one of these. But let's Maybe I'll hide one of these. But let's see what it looks like on mobile. And see what it looks like on mobile. And see what it looks like on mobile. And there we go. So yeah, it's a little bit there we go. So yeah, it's a little bit there we go. So yeah, it's a little bit too transparent for my liking, but all too transparent for my liking, but all too transparent for my liking, but all you would need to do is simply put in a you would need to do is simply put in a you would need to do is simply put in a request that, hey, make it so I can see request that, hey, make it so I can see request that, hey, make it so I can see the text better. That just about does it the text better. That just about does it the text better. That just about does it in today's video on something that in today's video on something that in today's video on something that fundamentally would have taken so much fundamentally would have taken so much fundamentally would have taken so much longer in the past. So make sure leave a longer in the past. So make sure leave a longer in the past. So make sure leave a like. It is completely free. And as you like. It is completely free. And as you like. It is completely free. And as you already know, these style videos, I'll already know, these style videos, I'll already know, these style videos, I'll see you in the next cursor. AI just made see you in the next cursor. AI just made see you in the next cursor. AI just made front end engineering extremely easy front end engineering extremely easy front end engineering extremely easy when it comes to mobile responsiveness when it comes to mobile responsiveness when it comes to mobile responsiveness where something that would have taken a where something that would have taken a where something that would have taken a couple of hours before now only takes a couple of hours before now only takes a couple of hours before now only takes a agent to run for 8 minutes and then you agent to run for 8 minutes and then you agent to run for 8 minutes and then you can review the code and get the best can review the code and get the best can review the code and get the best code type of video. Now, we're not code type of video. Now, we're not code type of video. Now, we're not talking about McDonald's, but if you talking about McDonald's, but if you talking about McDonald's, but if you love hamburgers, oh, take me to love hamburgers, oh, take me to love hamburgers, oh, take me to In-N-Out.

    "content": "=== YouTube Video: Cursor 2.0 is INSANE, but only if you use it like this... ===\nAuthor: Alex Finn\nVideo ID: qSW2kEbVvmU\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSW2kEbVvmU\nDuration: 1021\nUpload Date: Fri Nov 07 2025 04:31:13 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time)\n\n--- Key Points ---\n1. **Introduction of Cursor 2.0 Workflow:** The video introduces what is claimed to be the greatest workflow for using Cursor 2.0, promising to significantly speed up app development even for those with no coding experience.\n2. **Cursor 2.0 for Building Better UIs:** A new feature in Cursor 2.0 allows running a prompt multiple times simultaneously, which is particularly advantageous for developing user interfaces (UIs) by providing multiple design options to choose from.\n3. **Productivity App Example:** The workflow includes building a productivity app featuring a calendar and a to-do list side by side, demonstrating the practical application of Cursor 2.0 features.\n4. **Advantage of Running Multiple Prompts:** Running a prompt multiple times gives users a better chance of obtaining an attractive UI by avoiding generic designs and allowing the selection of the best option from multiple outputs.\n5. **Focus on UI Component Building:** The video emphasizes using Cursor 2.0 particularly for UI component creation, where it has the most significant impact on improving design quality.\n6. **Backend vs. Frontend Code in Cursor 2.0:** It's noted that while Cursor 2.0 generally handles backend code effectively 99.9% of the time, the quality of front-end code, especially UI design, is where improvements are most needed and can be most beneficial.\n7. **Practical Use Case:** By following the workflow, viewers can create a functional and aesthetically pleasing productivity app that they can start using immediately after the video.\n\n--- Full Transcript ---\nOkay, I figured out the greatest cursor Okay, I figured out the greatest cursor 2.0 workflow of all time. It is going to 2.0 workflow of all time. It is going to 2.0 workflow of all time. It is going to have you building apps faster than you have you building apps faster than you have you building apps faster than you ever have before. Even if you've never ever have before. Even if you've never ever have before. Even if you've never written a code in your life, if you written a code in your life, if you written a code in your life, if you stick with me here in 20 minutes, you're stick with me here in 20 minutes, you're stick with me here in 20 minutes, you're going to learn this workflow and you're going to learn this workflow and you're going to learn this workflow and you're going to be a cursor 2.0 master. You're going to be a cursor 2.0 master. You're going to be a cursor 2.0 master. You're going to learn six tricks here that are going to learn six tricks here that are going to learn six tricks here that are going to absolutely blow your mind. going to absolutely blow your mind. going to absolutely blow your mind. You'll also have a full productivity app You'll also have a full productivity app You'll also have a full productivity app you'll be able to use anytime you want. you'll be able to use anytime you want. you'll be able to use anytime you want. So, let's lock in and get into it. This So, let's lock in and get into it. This So, let's lock in and get into it. This first step in the workflow will have you first step in the workflow will have you first step in the workflow will have you building way better UIs. And this is a building way better UIs. And this is a building way better UIs. And this is a brand new feature in cursor 2.0. In brand new feature in cursor 2.0. In brand new feature in cursor 2.0. In cursor 2.0, you can actually run a cursor 2.0, you can actually run a cursor 2.0, you can actually run a prompt multiple times simultaneously. prompt multiple times simultaneously. prompt multiple times simultaneously. Now, what's the advantage of this? Why Now, what's the advantage of this? Why Now, what's the advantage of this? Why would you want to do this? You want to would you want to do this? You want to would you want to do this? You want to do this whenever you're building out a do this whenever you're building out a do this whenever you're building out a UI. This will give you multiple options UI. This will give you multiple options UI. This will give you multiple options of a UI to ensure you get an actual of a UI to ensure you get an actual of a UI to ensure you get an actual beautiful one instead of that purple and beautiful one instead of that purple and beautiful one instead of that purple and blue gradient you get with every AI. So, blue gradient you get with every AI. So, blue gradient you get with every AI. So, steal this prompt from down below and steal this prompt from down below and steal this prompt from down below and build this out with me. I'll show you build this out with me. I'll show you build this out with me. I'll show you how this works. I'm going to build out a how this works. I'm going to build out a how this works. I'm going to build out a productivity app that includes a productivity app that includes a productivity app that includes a calendar and a to-do list side by side. calendar and a to-do list side by side. calendar and a to-do list side by side. You should be able to click and drag to You should be able to click and drag to You should be able to click and drag to to-do items from the list to the to-do items from the list to the to-do items from the list to the calendar so you can see your complete calendar so you can see your complete calendar so you can see your complete day. By the way, if you do this, you'll day. By the way, if you do this, you'll day. By the way, if you do this, you'll have an awesome app you can just start have an awesome app you can just start have an awesome app you can just start using right after the video. Uh, but using right after the video. Uh, but using right after the video. Uh, but let's do this. Here's the first step in let's do this. Here's the first step in let's do this. Here's the first step in this workflow and taking advantage of this workflow and taking advantage of this workflow and taking advantage of this new feature in Cursor 2.0. You see this new feature in Cursor 2.0. You see this new feature in Cursor 2.0. You see this 1x here? This is the amount of this 1x here? This is the amount of this 1x here? This is the amount of cycles the agent will do. So, let's cycles the agent will do. So, let's cycles the agent will do. So, let's actually do 4x. And what's going to actually do 4x. And what's going to actually do 4x. And what's going to happen here is the AI will run this happen here is the AI will run this happen here is the AI will run this prompt four times for us. And then we prompt four times for us. And then we prompt four times for us. And then we can choose what UI we like the best. can choose what UI we like the best. can choose what UI we like the best. This will give us a lot better shot of This will give us a lot better shot of This will give us a lot better shot of getting better UI. The trick here is getting better UI. The trick here is getting better UI. The trick here is just using this when you're building out just using this when you're building out just using this when you're building out UI components. Cursor is smart enough UI components. Cursor is smart enough UI components. Cursor is smart enough where your backend code's going to be where your backend code's going to be where your backend code's going to be good 99.9% of the time. It's the good 99.9% of the time. It's the good 99.9% of the time. It's the front-end code, the UI where the AI front-end code, the UI where the AI front-end code, the UI where the AI typically lacks taste. So let's hit send typically lacks taste. So let's hit send typically lacks taste. So let's hit send on this. And the AI is now going to on this. And the AI is now going to on this. And the AI is now going to build out this app for us. and this UI build out this app for us. and this UI build out this app for us. and this UI four different times using sonnet 45 four different times using sonnet 45 four different times using sonnet 45 which I think is the best AI model for which I think is the best AI model for which I think is the best AI model for coding right now and when this is done coding right now and when this is done coding right now and when this is done we can see those four different UIs and we can see those four different UIs and we can see those four different UIs and as this is building I know what your as this is building I know what your as this is building I know what your concern is won't this eat up a ton of concern is won't this eat up a ton of concern is won't this eat up a ton of tokens and basically send you broke well tokens and basically send you broke well tokens and basically send you broke well yes if you do this for every single yes if you do this for every single yes if you do this for every single prompt you do it will use up all your prompt you do it will use up all your prompt you do it will use up all your tokens the key again is using this just tokens the key again is using this just tokens the key again is using this just for building out UI whenever you do UI for building out UI whenever you do UI for building out UI whenever you do UI components that's when you use the 4x components that's when you use the 4x components that's when you use the 4x multiplier it's basically going to give multiplier it's basically going to give multiplier it's basically going to give us a menu of UIs that we can build out us a menu of UIs that we can build out us a menu of UIs that we can build out here. By the way, so many awesome here. By the way, so many awesome here. By the way, so many awesome features in Cursor 2.0 that I'm going to features in Cursor 2.0 that I'm going to features in Cursor 2.0 that I'm going to show you how to use in a second. This show you how to use in a second. This show you how to use in a second. This workflow changed how I use this app workflow changed how I use this app workflow changed how I use this app completely. Okay, looks like Cursor completely. Okay, looks like Cursor completely. Okay, looks like Cursor finished working on all four runs of finished working on all four runs of finished working on all four runs of building out our app. Now, what we're building out our app. Now, what we're building out our app. Now, what we're going to do is actually test out each going to do is actually test out each going to do is actually test out each run to see which one looks the best so run to see which one looks the best so run to see which one looks the best so we can get the absolute best UI we can get the absolute best UI we can get the absolute best UI possible. So now let's test each one of possible. So now let's test each one of possible. So now let's test each one of these four variations out so we can see these four variations out so we can see these four variations out so we can see which one created the best UI so we can which one created the best UI so we can which one created the best UI so we can have the best UI possible for our have the best UI possible for our have the best UI possible for our productivity app. The setup to do this productivity app. The setup to do this productivity app. The setup to do this pretty straightforward. Just follow pretty straightforward. Just follow pretty straightforward. Just follow along with me here. I'll show you along with me here. I'll show you along with me here. I'll show you exactly how to switch the code between exactly how to switch the code between exactly how to switch the code between these four variations so we can test it these four variations so we can test it these four variations so we can test it out. The first thing you want to do is out. The first thing you want to do is out. The first thing you want to do is open up your terminal. So do control open up your terminal. So do control open up your terminal. So do control tillday to open up your terminal just tillday to open up your terminal just tillday to open up your terminal just like you see here. By the way, to do like you see here. By the way, to do like you see here. By the way, to do this first step of the workflow, you're this first step of the workflow, you're this first step of the workflow, you're just going to want to make sure your just going to want to make sure your just going to want to make sure your code lives on GitHub. So sign up for code lives on GitHub. So sign up for code lives on GitHub. So sign up for GitHub if you haven't. If that confuses GitHub if you haven't. If that confuses GitHub if you haven't. If that confuses you, if you've never used GitHub before, you, if you've never used GitHub before, you, if you've never used GitHub before, just tell the agent in cursor, hey, I just tell the agent in cursor, hey, I just tell the agent in cursor, hey, I want to put this on GitHub. It'll show want to put this on GitHub. It'll show want to put this on GitHub. It'll show you exactly how to do it. It'll do it you exactly how to do it. It'll do it you exactly how to do it. It'll do it for you. Once you do that, you're good for you. Once you do that, you're good for you. Once you do that, you're good to go for this first step of the to go for this first step of the to go for this first step of the workflow. Now that we're in the workflow. Now that we're in the workflow. Now that we're in the terminal, we're going to want to go to terminal, we're going to want to go to terminal, we're going to want to go to the folder that has each one of these the folder that has each one of these the folder that has each one of these variations. To do that, you're just variations. To do that, you're just variations. To do that, you're just going to want to do cd and then the path going to want to do cd and then the path going to want to do cd and then the path to that variation. to see the path of to that variation. to see the path of to that variation. to see the path of that variation. If you click review up that variation. If you click review up that variation. If you click review up here, it opens up this tiny window and here, it opens up this tiny window and here, it opens up this tiny window and then hover over the variation, these then hover over the variation, these then hover over the variation, these letters right here, you can see if you letters right here, you can see if you letters right here, you can see if you click that, there are your four click that, there are your four click that, there are your four variations. And if you hover over each variations. And if you hover over each variations. And if you hover over each one, you can see the path to that one, you can see the path to that one, you can see the path to that variation. So, you're just going to do variation. So, you're just going to do variation. So, you're just going to do in your terminal cd and then the path in your terminal cd and then the path in your terminal cd and then the path you see there. When you hit enter on you see there. When you hit enter on you see there. When you hit enter on that, it's going to take you to that that, it's going to take you to that that, it's going to take you to that variation. Then you just do npmi. You variation. Then you just do npmi. You variation. Then you just do npmi. You hit enter on that, it'll install the hit enter on that, it'll install the hit enter on that, it'll install the technology for that variation onto your technology for that variation onto your technology for that variation onto your computer. And then you hit npm rundev. computer. And then you hit npm rundev. computer. And then you hit npm rundev. And that actually runs the server with And that actually runs the server with And that actually runs the server with that code on it. I know that might sound that code on it. I know that might sound that code on it. I know that might sound a little confusing, but if you do that a little confusing, but if you do that a little confusing, but if you do that one time, all you're going to need to do one time, all you're going to need to do one time, all you're going to need to do to rerun those commands is hit up on to rerun those commands is hit up on to rerun those commands is hit up on your keyboard and it will pull open your your keyboard and it will pull open your your keyboard and it will pull open your pass command. So you can just put in the pass command. So you can just put in the pass command. So you can just put in the other variations very easily. Once you other variations very easily. Once you other variations very easily. Once you do that, you hit npm rundev. It'll start do that, you hit npm rundev. It'll start do that, you hit npm rundev. It'll start the server. You can go to the server and the server. You can go to the server and the server. You can go to the server and we can see what each variation looks we can see what each variation looks we can see what each variation looks like. So, I'm going to pull that over. like. So, I'm going to pull that over. like. So, I'm going to pull that over. That's actually a pretty good UI. Uh, That's actually a pretty good UI. Uh, That's actually a pretty good UI. Uh, that's rather clean. It's what I'm that's rather clean. It's what I'm that's rather clean. It's what I'm looking for. Kind of black and white, looking for. Kind of black and white, looking for. Kind of black and white, monochrome, very easy to look at and monochrome, very easy to look at and monochrome, very easy to look at and read. I like that. Let's check out the read. I like that. Let's check out the read. I like that. Let's check out the other variations to see what they look other variations to see what they look other variations to see what they look like. So, I'm going to go in and I'm like. So, I'm going to go in and I'm like. So, I'm going to go in and I'm going to CD into another variation. So, going to CD into another variation. So, going to CD into another variation. So, let's CD into KLUXW. I hit enter on let's CD into KLUXW. I hit enter on let's CD into KLUXW. I hit enter on that. That puts me in the folder. Then, that. That puts me in the folder. Then, that. That puts me in the folder. Then, we can just do npmi to install it. And we can just do npmi to install it. And we can just do npmi to install it. And then I'm going to do npm rundev to open then I'm going to do npm rundev to open then I'm going to do npm rundev to open it up. Let's go back in. Let's see what it up. Let's go back in. Let's see what it up. Let's go back in. Let's see what this looks like. Boom. We pull that this looks like. Boom. We pull that this looks like. Boom. We pull that over. Uh, I actually might like this a over. Uh, I actually might like this a over. Uh, I actually might like this a little bit more. I like this weekly little bit more. I like this weekly little bit more. I like this weekly view. Let's see what this looks like view. Let's see what this looks like view. Let's see what this looks like with the task. Build an app. Add it. with the task. Build an app. Add it. with the task. Build an app. Add it. Okay, let's drag it onto the calendar. Okay, let's drag it onto the calendar. Okay, let's drag it onto the calendar. That's pretty nice. I kind of like the That's pretty nice. I kind of like the That's pretty nice. I kind of like the way this looks. Let's see what happens way this looks. Let's see what happens way this looks. Let's see what happens when multiple. Okay, it puts on to I when multiple. Okay, it puts on to I when multiple. Okay, it puts on to I like the way that it's more of a week like the way that it's more of a week like the way that it's more of a week view so we can focus on our week. Now, view so we can focus on our week. Now, view so we can focus on our week. Now, let's test out the other variations. I'm let's test out the other variations. I'm let's test out the other variations. I'm going to come back in here. Let's do going to come back in here. Let's do going to come back in here. Let's do JGR8A, JGR8A, JGR8A, then npmi as always, and then npm rundev then npmi as always, and then npm rundev then npmi as always, and then npm rundev to run it. Now, let's see what this one to run it. Now, let's see what this one to run it. Now, let's see what this one looks like. Okay, similar to the last looks like. Okay, similar to the last looks like. Okay, similar to the last one, but it's the full month view. I one, but it's the full month view. I one, but it's the full month view. I think I like the week view better. Let's think I like the week view better. Let's think I like the week view better. Let's see this build in app. We're going to see this build in app. We're going to see this build in app. We're going to hit enter. We're going to drag that in. hit enter. We're going to drag that in. hit enter. We're going to drag that in. Oh, I I like the way it actually looks Oh, I I like the way it actually looks Oh, I I like the way it actually looks on the calendar a little bit more, on the calendar a little bit more, on the calendar a little bit more, though. It looks a little bit more though. It looks a little bit more though. It looks a little bit more clean. This might be in the lead right clean. This might be in the lead right clean. This might be in the lead right now. Let's just check out the last now. Let's just check out the last now. Let's just check out the last variation to see which one we like. The variation to see which one we like. The variation to see which one we like. The last one's HM23s. last one's HM23s. last one's HM23s. Let's CD into that. HM23S. Enter. NPMI. Let's CD into that. HM23S. Enter. NPMI. Let's CD into that. HM23S. Enter. NPMI. And then npm rundev. Now, let's check And then npm rundev. Now, let's check And then npm rundev. Now, let's check this out. Let's see what the final this out. Let's see what the final this out. Let's see what the final variation looks like. Okay, slight variation looks like. Okay, slight variation looks like. Okay, slight different colors. We got a lighter different colors. We got a lighter different colors. We got a lighter green. Let's do build an app. Let's put green. Let's do build an app. Let's put green. Let's do build an app. Let's put it on here. And yeah, I don't like this it on here. And yeah, I don't like this it on here. And yeah, I don't like this quite as much. The X is off there. So, quite as much. The X is off there. So, quite as much. The X is off there. So, the UI is not quite as good. I actually the UI is not quite as good. I actually the UI is not quite as good. I actually like the UI the most on the last one. like the UI the most on the last one. like the UI the most on the last one. So, let's pull that one in. So, the So, let's pull that one in. So, the So, let's pull that one in. So, the winner was JGR8A. winner was JGR8A. winner was JGR8A. If you actually then click on that If you actually then click on that If you actually then click on that variation, you can see it right there. variation, you can see it right there. variation, you can see it right there. JGR8A. JGR8A. JGR8A. Once you have that clicked and selected, Once you have that clicked and selected, Once you have that clicked and selected, we'll hit review to pop that open. And we'll hit review to pop that open. And we'll hit review to pop that open. And then we're going to click apply all. And then we're going to click apply all. And then we're going to click apply all. And that's going to take all the code from that's going to take all the code from that's going to take all the code from this specific variation and and apply it this specific variation and and apply it this specific variation and and apply it to our application locally. So this is to our application locally. So this is to our application locally. So this is basically choosing the winner. So I'm basically choosing the winner. So I'm basically choosing the winner. So I'm going to click apply all on that. And going to click apply all on that. And going to click apply all on that. And now if we go to our editor, boom, you now if we go to our editor, boom, you now if we go to our editor, boom, you can see all the code from that can see all the code from that can see all the code from that variations there. We chose our winner. variations there. We chose our winner. variations there. We chose our winner. Again, you only really want to do the Again, you only really want to do the Again, you only really want to do the use multiple models or run multiple use multiple models or run multiple use multiple models or run multiple times when doing UI. This will allow you times when doing UI. This will allow you times when doing UI. This will allow you to get the best UI possible. You don't to get the best UI possible. You don't to get the best UI possible. You don't need to do it for every single change need to do it for every single change need to do it for every single change you do cuz then you're just wasting you do cuz then you're just wasting you do cuz then you're just wasting tokens and it'll get very expensive. But tokens and it'll get very expensive. But tokens and it'll get very expensive. But if you do it just for UI changes, you're if you do it just for UI changes, you're if you do it just for UI changes, you're going to be in a really good place. All going to be in a really good place. All going to be in a really good place. All right, let's move on to the next step of right, let's move on to the next step of right, let's move on to the next step of the workflow, which is using the browser the workflow, which is using the browser the workflow, which is using the browser to its full potential. In Cursor 2.0, to its full potential. In Cursor 2.0, to its full potential. In Cursor 2.0, they just released a brand new browser. they just released a brand new browser. they just released a brand new browser. It is built into Cursor. If you click on It is built into Cursor. If you click on It is built into Cursor. If you click on this button right here inside of the this button right here inside of the this button right here inside of the agent, you can see browser tab in Google agent, you can see browser tab in Google agent, you can see browser tab in Google Chrome. click browser tab and it will Chrome. click browser tab and it will Chrome. click browser tab and it will actually open up a browser with your app actually open up a browser with your app actually open up a browser with your app running inside of it inside cursor. Now, running inside of it inside cursor. Now, running inside of it inside cursor. Now, this is cool, right? Not only can you this is cool, right? Not only can you this is cool, right? Not only can you actually see your app in real time and actually see your app in real time and actually see your app in real time and cursor, but here's where it gets really cursor, but here's where it gets really cursor, but here's where it gets really interesting. We can now actually start interesting. We can now actually start interesting. We can now actually start to use the browser to build out new to use the browser to build out new to use the browser to build out new features in real time. So, let's do features in real time. So, let's do features in real time. So, let's do this. Watch me here. We're going to add this. Watch me here. We're going to add this. Watch me here. We're going to add a brand new feature. I want to add a a brand new feature. I want to add a a brand new feature. I want to add a weekly view to our app. So, I'm going to weekly view to our app. So, I'm going to weekly view to our app. So, I'm going to say this to the agent. I want to build a say this to the agent. I want to build a say this to the agent. I want to build a weekly view for the calendar. Please weekly view for the calendar. Please weekly view for the calendar. Please place it here. And then I can use this place it here. And then I can use this place it here. And then I can use this select element button here in the top select element button here in the top select element button here in the top right. And what we can do is we can right. And what we can do is we can right. And what we can do is we can actually select where we want this actually select where we want this actually select where we want this button. So if I highlight the element button. So if I highlight the element button. So if I highlight the element where I want to place this new button, I where I want to place this new button, I where I want to place this new button, I can click. And what you can see here is can click. And what you can see here is can click. And what you can see here is it actually put that element inside the it actually put that element inside the it actually put that element inside the chat with the agent. So we can tell chat with the agent. So we can tell chat with the agent. So we can tell exactly where we want these new features exactly where we want these new features exactly where we want these new features built. I'm going to hit enter on this. built. I'm going to hit enter on this. built. I'm going to hit enter on this. And there's a lot more use cases around And there's a lot more use cases around And there's a lot more use cases around the select element button I'll go into the select element button I'll go into the select element button I'll go into in just a second here. But just for in just a second here. But just for in just a second here. But just for placing features, you can see this will placing features, you can see this will placing features, you can see this will work really well where we'll now work really well where we'll now work really well where we'll now actually get that new button exactly actually get that new button exactly actually get that new button exactly where we told the AI to put it. And this where we told the AI to put it. And this where we told the AI to put it. And this is a big problem with a lot of these AI is a big problem with a lot of these AI is a big problem with a lot of these AI builders is you ask to make a change and builders is you ask to make a change and builders is you ask to make a change and unless you're hyper hyper specific, unless you're hyper hyper specific, unless you're hyper hyper specific, it'll make changes you're not really it'll make changes you're not really it'll make changes you're not really looking for. Now, because this builtin looking for. Now, because this builtin looking for. Now, because this builtin browser inside cursor, we can actually browser inside cursor, we can actually browser inside cursor, we can actually tell it exactly where to put the tell it exactly where to put the tell it exactly where to put the different changes. This is also different changes. This is also different changes. This is also spectacular for debugging. In a second, spectacular for debugging. In a second, spectacular for debugging. In a second, I'll show you how to debug with this I'll show you how to debug with this I'll show you how to debug with this brand new browser, and it's going to brand new browser, and it's going to brand new browser, and it's going to make your life so much easier. But check make your life so much easier. But check make your life so much easier. But check this change out it does here. All right, this change out it does here. All right, this change out it does here. All right, so let's refresh the app here and see so let's refresh the app here and see so let's refresh the app here and see what we get. And boom, there it is. You what we get. And boom, there it is. You what we get. And boom, there it is. You can see it happens in real time. It adds can see it happens in real time. It adds can see it happens in real time. It adds the button to the actual calendar the button to the actual calendar the button to the actual calendar exactly where we put it. So I can exactly where we put it. So I can exactly where we put it. So I can toggle, yep, between month and week and toggle, yep, between month and week and toggle, yep, between month and week and it works perfectly. So now we can be a it works perfectly. So now we can be a it works perfectly. So now we can be a lot more precise with where our changes lot more precise with where our changes lot more precise with where our changes go. But on top of that, this is great go. But on top of that, this is great go. But on top of that, this is great for debugging. Say that change we made for debugging. Say that change we made for debugging. Say that change we made didn't work right there. We'd be able to didn't work right there. We'd be able to didn't work right there. We'd be able to go in and say, \"Hey, this functionality go in and say, \"Hey, this functionality go in and say, \"Hey, this functionality right here is broken.\" And then I can right here is broken.\" And then I can right here is broken.\" And then I can use the select element button and choose use the select element button and choose use the select element button and choose which element is broken. Right? So if which element is broken. Right? So if which element is broken. Right? So if it's those buttons, I can choose those it's those buttons, I can choose those it's those buttons, I can choose those and place it in. Say it's adding the and place it in. Say it's adding the and place it in. Say it's adding the to-do list is broken, I can click that to-do list is broken, I can click that to-do list is broken, I can click that and it'll put the element in there. So and it'll put the element in there. So and it'll put the element in there. So now we can be super precise about our now we can be super precise about our now we can be super precise about our issues as well. Before you had to like issues as well. Before you had to like issues as well. Before you had to like copy and paste entire paragraphs of copy and paste entire paragraphs of copy and paste entire paragraphs of debugging from the consoles which is a debugging from the consoles which is a debugging from the consoles which is a lot of work. Now we can just say select lot of work. Now we can just say select lot of work. Now we can just say select element, click on it and it's add to our element, click on it and it's add to our element, click on it and it's add to our chat. Boom. Tons of time saved. You need chat. Boom. Tons of time saved. You need chat. Boom. Tons of time saved. You need to be using the inapp browser in cursor to be using the inapp browser in cursor to be using the inapp browser in cursor 2.0 and you need to be using that select 2.0 and you need to be using that select 2.0 and you need to be using that select element. You're going to be saving so element. You're going to be saving so element. You're going to be saving so much time in the long run. I have three much time in the long run. I have three much time in the long run. I have three more steps in this incredible workflow I more steps in this incredible workflow I more steps in this incredible workflow I want to show you. The next one is really want to show you. The next one is really want to show you. The next one is really simple and easy. The two after that are simple and easy. The two after that are simple and easy. The two after that are going to absolutely blow your mind. But going to absolutely blow your mind. But going to absolutely blow your mind. But let's start with the next one, which is let's start with the next one, which is let's start with the next one, which is really, really easy. People don't really, really easy. People don't really, really easy. People don't realize this, but there's actually a realize this, but there's actually a realize this, but there's actually a command inside Cursor 2.0 that just command inside Cursor 2.0 that just command inside Cursor 2.0 that just instantly improves your app and code. If instantly improves your app and code. If instantly improves your app and code. If you go into any change you make in any you go into any change you make in any you go into any change you make in any agent and type in slash review and hit agent and type in slash review and hit agent and type in slash review and hit enter on agent review, it automatically enter on agent review, it automatically enter on agent review, it automatically has an AI agent go in, review all your has an AI agent go in, review all your has an AI agent go in, review all your code, look for security issues, look for code, look for security issues, look for code, look for security issues, look for efficiency issues, look for little efficiency issues, look for little efficiency issues, look for little tweaks it can make to improve it, and it tweaks it can make to improve it, and it tweaks it can make to improve it, and it just reviews it. Done. 10 seconds in, just reviews it. Done. 10 seconds in, just reviews it. Done. 10 seconds in, agent review, found no issues. It went agent review, found no issues. It went agent review, found no issues. It went through every line of code we did and through every line of code we did and through every line of code we did and found any security issues could find or found any security issues could find or found any security issues could find or any other problems. This is such a small any other problems. This is such a small any other problems. This is such a small quality of life improvement that nobody quality of life improvement that nobody quality of life improvement that nobody is using that you have to start taking is using that you have to start taking is using that you have to start taking advantage of. Anytime you make any sort advantage of. Anytime you make any sort advantage of. Anytime you make any sort of moderate to large change in your of moderate to large change in your of moderate to large change in your codebase, you want to just make sure you codebase, you want to just make sure you codebase, you want to just make sure you do slash and then click on agent review do slash and then click on agent review do slash and then click on agent review and automatically the moment you click and automatically the moment you click and automatically the moment you click it, an AI agent will go and review every it, an AI agent will go and review every it, an AI agent will go and review every change you made in the previous step. change you made in the previous step. change you made in the previous step. This is a really small, simple change in This is a really small, simple change in This is a really small, simple change in your workflow that will yield way better your workflow that will yield way better your workflow that will yield way better results and your app will just get so results and your app will just get so results and your app will just get so much better over time. you won't have much better over time. you won't have much better over time. you won't have that massive tech debt you have that you that massive tech debt you have that you that massive tech debt you have that you usually get from making changes with AI usually get from making changes with AI usually get from making changes with AI without reviewing your code. It's also without reviewing your code. It's also without reviewing your code. It's also really great for people who have never really great for people who have never really great for people who have never really coded before. The next two steps really coded before. The next two steps really coded before. The next two steps in the workflow are tightly connected in the workflow are tightly connected in the workflow are tightly connected and this is the cursor hidden mobile app and this is the cursor hidden mobile app and this is the cursor hidden mobile app and this is the cloud agents in that and this is the cloud agents in that and this is the cloud agents in that hidden mobile app. People don't realize hidden mobile app. People don't realize hidden mobile app. People don't realize this but there is actually a mobile app this but there is actually a mobile app this but there is actually a mobile app for cursor. So this is me mirroring my for cursor. So this is me mirroring my for cursor. So this is me mirroring my iPhone right here. People don't realize iPhone right here. People don't realize iPhone right here. People don't realize there's actually a cursor mobile app. there's actually a cursor mobile app. there's actually a cursor mobile app. The thing is it's hidden. It's not The thing is it's hidden. It's not The thing is it's hidden. It's not actually in the app store. What you need actually in the app store. What you need actually in the app store. What you need to do to get this cursor app on your to do to get this cursor app on your to do to get this cursor app on your phone is pretty straightforward. You phone is pretty straightforward. You phone is pretty straightforward. You first need to go to Safari. So, if I first need to go to Safari. So, if I first need to go to Safari. So, if I open up Safari from here and hit enter. open up Safari from here and hit enter. open up Safari from here and hit enter. And now inside Safari, all I need to do And now inside Safari, all I need to do And now inside Safari, all I need to do is go to cursor.com, go to the website, is go to cursor.com, go to the website, is go to cursor.com, go to the website, and then all you need to do is click try and then all you need to do is click try and then all you need to do is click try mobile agent and then add this to your mobile agent and then add this to your mobile agent and then add this to your iPhone desktop. So, this is kind of iPhone desktop. So, this is kind of iPhone desktop. So, this is kind of hidden, so stick with me here. You hit hidden, so stick with me here. You hit hidden, so stick with me here. You hit the three dots at the bottom. Then you the three dots at the bottom. Then you the three dots at the bottom. Then you go to share. Once you're in share, click go to share. Once you're in share, click go to share. Once you're in share, click the three dots at the bottom again. And the three dots at the bottom again. And the three dots at the bottom again. And then you will see add to home screen then you will see add to home screen then you will see add to home screen right there. Clicking that one more right there. Clicking that one more right there. Clicking that one more time, the add to home screen button will time, the add to home screen button will time, the add to home screen button will actually take this app and put it on actually take this app and put it on actually take this app and put it on your home screen. And basically make it your home screen. And basically make it your home screen. And basically make it like it's its own mobile app. You like it's its own mobile app. You like it's its own mobile app. You wouldn't be able to tell the difference. wouldn't be able to tell the difference. wouldn't be able to tell the difference. So you click it. Now you're here and So you click it. Now you're here and So you click it. Now you're here and you're in the cursor mobile app where you're in the cursor mobile app where you're in the cursor mobile app where you can code on the go. Not many people you can code on the go. Not many people you can code on the go. Not many people know about this, but now you have a know about this, but now you have a know about this, but now you have a fully optimized mobile experience for fully optimized mobile experience for fully optimized mobile experience for cursor where you can build on the go. cursor where you can build on the go. cursor where you can build on the go. And I use this all the time. My brain And I use this all the time. My brain And I use this all the time. My brain juices go the fastest when I'm at the juices go the fastest when I'm at the juices go the fastest when I'm at the gym. Whenever I'm at the gym, I come up gym. Whenever I'm at the gym, I come up gym. Whenever I'm at the gym, I come up with so many ideas. And so I like to with so many ideas. And so I like to with so many ideas. And so I like to have this on me where when I come up have this on me where when I come up have this on me where when I come up with the ideas, I pull it open and I can with the ideas, I pull it open and I can with the ideas, I pull it open and I can send commands to cursor to do work. But send commands to cursor to do work. But send commands to cursor to do work. But here's what's cool about this. These are here's what's cool about this. These are here's what's cool about this. These are all cloud agents. So these all make all cloud agents. So these all make all cloud agents. So these all make changes in the cloud. They're not making changes in the cloud. They're not making changes in the cloud. They're not making on your computer. So you can spin up as on your computer. So you can spin up as on your computer. So you can spin up as many changes as you want and then pull many changes as you want and then pull many changes as you want and then pull them down when you go back to your them down when you go back to your them down when you go back to your computer. The next step in this workflow computer. The next step in this workflow computer. The next step in this workflow is getting the mobile app. The step is getting the mobile app. The step is getting the mobile app. The step after that is actually spinning up these after that is actually spinning up these after that is actually spinning up these cloud agents to do many important things cloud agents to do many important things cloud agents to do many important things for you on the go. The first thing I for you on the go. The first thing I for you on the go. The first thing I like to do is have it make tiny little like to do is have it make tiny little like to do is have it make tiny little changes to our app. It's very good for changes to our app. It's very good for changes to our app. It's very good for making those quick changes. So if we making those quick changes. So if we making those quick changes. So if we want to make it so build out a dark mode want to make it so build out a dark mode want to make it so build out a dark mode for our app, I can hit send on that and for our app, I can hit send on that and for our app, I can hit send on that and it will start making changes in the it will start making changes in the it will start making changes in the cloud that we can then pull down and cloud that we can then pull down and cloud that we can then pull down and test locally on our computer. But it's test locally on our computer. But it's test locally on our computer. But it's also really good for things that aren't also really good for things that aren't also really good for things that aren't code related, right? Right? So if we code related, right? Right? So if we code related, right? Right? So if we want to go in and have it do research want to go in and have it do research want to go in and have it do research for marketing or make a road map for us, for marketing or make a road map for us, for marketing or make a road map for us, we can say build out a feature road map we can say build out a feature road map we can say build out a feature road map for us that I can review. And then I hit for us that I can review. And then I hit for us that I can review. And then I hit enter. And now it's going to develop an enter. And now it's going to develop an enter. And now it's going to develop an entire road map for us that we can then entire road map for us that we can then entire road map for us that we can then pull down, review, and think about what pull down, review, and think about what pull down, review, and think about what features we want. We can also say, write features we want. We can also say, write features we want. We can also say, write out an announcement blog post for us. out an announcement blog post for us. out an announcement blog post for us. And I can hit enter. And now it's doing And I can hit enter. And now it's doing And I can hit enter. And now it's doing marketing for us in the cloud. These are marketing for us in the cloud. These are marketing for us in the cloud. These are all cloud agents working simultaneously all cloud agents working simultaneously all cloud agents working simultaneously that I can now pull down in my local that I can now pull down in my local that I can now pull down in my local environment and review what they do. So, environment and review what they do. So, environment and review what they do. So, this is fantastic for when you're on the this is fantastic for when you're on the this is fantastic for when you're on the go. I also really like this. This is a go. I also really like this. This is a go. I also really like this. This is a hack for you. Before I go to bed, I hack for you. Before I go to bed, I hack for you. Before I go to bed, I always try to make sure I have a few always try to make sure I have a few always try to make sure I have a few different processes going in the cloud. different processes going in the cloud. different processes going in the cloud. So, before you go to bed, download the So, before you go to bed, download the So, before you go to bed, download the Cursor mobile app onto your phone. go Cursor mobile app onto your phone. go Cursor mobile app onto your phone. go into it and make sure you have at least into it and make sure you have at least into it and make sure you have at least a few tasks going before you go to bed a few tasks going before you go to bed a few tasks going before you go to bed so that when you wake up in the morning, so that when you wake up in the morning, so that when you wake up in the morning, you can review the changes and get them you can review the changes and get them you can review the changes and get them committed so you always have committed so you always have committed so you always have productivity. You always have changes productivity. You always have changes productivity. You always have changes going. As you can see, we already have going. As you can see, we already have going. As you can see, we already have the road map built out. So, we can go in the road map built out. So, we can go in the road map built out. So, we can go in here. Here's the road map details. We here. Here's the road map details. We here. Here's the road map details. We can see all the features it thought of can see all the features it thought of can see all the features it thought of for our road map. And so, we're always for our road map. And so, we're always for our road map. And so, we're always coming up and building out new things coming up and building out new things coming up and building out new things with Cursor, especially with this new with Cursor, especially with this new with Cursor, especially with this new cloud agent. If you download this cloud cloud agent. If you download this cloud cloud agent. If you download this cloud agent and you use it to its full agent and you use it to its full agent and you use it to its full potential when you're on the go before potential when you're on the go before potential when you're on the go before you go to bed, always making sure you you go to bed, always making sure you you go to bed, always making sure you have tasks running for your cloud agent have tasks running for your cloud agent have tasks running for your cloud agent so they're always putting in the most so they're always putting in the most so they're always putting in the most work and you have your employees working work and you have your employees working work and you have your employees working for you. You'll get so much more out of for you. You'll get so much more out of for you. You'll get so much more out of Curse. As you can see, the dark mode's Curse. As you can see, the dark mode's Curse. As you can see, the dark mode's already done. It's already implemented, already done. It's already implemented, already done. It's already implemented, right? We're getting features done and right? We're getting features done and right? We're getting features done and I'm just on my phone at the gym or I'm just on my phone at the gym or I'm just on my phone at the gym or getting a coffee, whatever I'm doing. getting a coffee, whatever I'm doing. getting a coffee, whatever I'm doing. This will make you 10 times more This will make you 10 times more This will make you 10 times more efficient with cursor. If you implement efficient with cursor. If you implement efficient with cursor. If you implement these steps I just showed you into the these steps I just showed you into the these steps I just showed you into the your workflow, you're going to get so your workflow, you're going to get so your workflow, you're going to get so much more done with cursor. So, we much more done with cursor. So, we much more done with cursor. So, we talked about doing multiple runs every talked about doing multiple runs every talked about doing multiple runs every time we make a UI change so you can get time we make a UI change so you can get time we make a UI change so you can get the best UI possible. We talked about the best UI possible. We talked about the best UI possible. We talked about using the browser so you can review your using the browser so you can review your using the browser so you can review your changes and debug in real time inside of changes and debug in real time inside of changes and debug in real time inside of cursor. We talked about using the cursor. We talked about using the cursor.
